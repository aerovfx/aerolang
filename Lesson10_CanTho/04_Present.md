Cần Thơ — The Wild West of Vietnam

Hey folks! Did you sleep well last night?
Hang, is your leg feeling better yet? Tuyen, how’s that stomach of yours — still at war?

Now it’s time to check out of the hotel and continue our glorious journey through the Mekong Delta.
First stop: Cần Thơ City — do you still have money left?
If you’re broke, just sell some gold. And if you have no gold? No worries, I’ll lend you some. Generosity is free… until I start charging interest.

Cần Thơ is the capital of the Mekong Delta, which is why it’s proudly nicknamed “Tây Đô” — the Western Capital.
First up, we’ll visit Phụng Hiệp Floating Market. We’ll rent a boat for just one million VND (a small fortune or a large coffee in Saigon).
While floating along, you’ll witness a truly one-of-a-kind market. You want it? They’ve got it — from fresh produce to secondhand sandals.

If you’re thirsty or hungry, no need to panic. A boat will row up to serve you right where you sit.
And gentlemen, if you’re feeling a little… adventurous, there are charming ladies in traditional áo bà ba ready to offer “full service from A to Z” — whatever that means. Use your imagination — and maybe your wallet.

Leaving Ninh Kiều Wharf, we’ll head to some fruit gardens, again for the low, low price of just one million VND.
But before you visit, don’t fill your belly — because the trees are practically begging you to eat their finest fruits: duku, durian, mangosteen, longan… delicious and dangerously addictive.

And if you’re curious about catfish farming, you’re in for a treat. Head over to the “poop bridge” (cầu tỏm) — yes, that’s what it’s called — and witness a fierce feeding frenzy. Those fish go at it like they haven’t eaten in years.

Feeling brave? Want to taste one of those catfish? Be patient — the garden owner will prepare it for you, served right to your face.

But be warned: once you taste it… there’s a solid chance you’ll throw up your entire ancestral bloodline.
