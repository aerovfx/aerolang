# Situational Dialogue: A Fun Day in Can Tho

**Characters:**
- **Tour Guide:** Mr. Minh
- **Tourist 1:** Linda
- **Tourist 2:** Tom

**Mr. Minh:**  
Good morning, everyone! Did you all sleep well last night?

**Linda:**  
Yes, I did! The bed was super comfy.

**Tom:**  
Ugh, not really. I think I ate too much durian yesterday…

**Mr. Minh:**  
*(laughing)* Classic mistake, Tom! Durian’s not for the weak.  
Hang on—Linda, is your leg feeling better?

**Linda:**  
Much better, thanks! I can walk fine now.

**Mr. Minh:**  
Great! Because today, we’re going to **Phung Hiep Floating Market**!  
We’ll rent a small boat. It costs about **1 million VND**, but don’t worry—it comes with an unforgettable experience!

**Tom:**  
Do we pay in cash or card?

**Mr. Minh:**  
Cash only, my friend.  
If you’re out of cash, just sell your gold.  
And if you don’t have gold—I’ll lend you some money… *with interest, of course!* 

**Linda:**  
Haha! Very helpful, Mr. Minh.

**Mr. Minh:**  
This market is one of a kind. You’ll see everything from high-end electronics to pineapples.  
And if you’re hungry or thirsty, the vendors will row right up to your boat. *Service on water!*

**Tom:**  
Can I also “sleep on the boat”? 

**Mr. Minh:**  
Ahhh… That depends. If you spot a lady in a traditional **áo bà ba**, be careful—she might serve you from A to Z! *(everyone laughs)*

**Linda:**  
What’s next after the market?

**Mr. Minh:**  
We’ll stop by **Ninh Kieu Wharf** and visit the fruit gardens.  
But don’t eat anything now! There are duku, mangosteen, durian, longan – all waiting for you.

**Tom:**  
And what’s that place you mentioned—“Cầu tỏm”?

**Mr. Minh:**  
Yes! That’s where you’ll see catfish fighting like gladiators over food.  
And if you want to eat them, just ask the orchard owner. But warning:  
If your stomach is weak, you might throw up your whole family tree!

**Linda:**  
That sounds terrifying and delicious at the same time.

**Mr. Minh:**  
That’s the spirit! Now hop on the boat, everyone — let’s float into adventure!
