00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everyone! Did you sleep well last night?

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,500
Hang, is your leg feeling better? And Tuyen, is your stomach still hurting?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Now let’s check out and continue our trip to the Western Region.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,000
The first place we’ll visit is Can Tho City. Do you all still have money?

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,000
If someone’s run out of cash, go ahead and sell your gold.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,000
And if you don’t have any gold, don’t worry — I’ll lend you some money.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,000
Can Tho is the capital of the Western Region, which is why it’s called Tay Do – the “Western Capital.”

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,000
First, we’ll visit Phung Hiep Floating Market. We’ll rent a small boat for about 1 million VND.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,000
While sitting in the boat, you can watch a truly unique market — one that you’ll only find in Vietnam.

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,500
This market has everything from top-tier goods to bargain-basement items.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If you’re thirsty or hungry, vendors will row straight to you.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,000
And if any of you gentlemen are thinking about “sleeping on the boat,” let me just say: there are long-legged beauties in traditional áo bà ba outfits, ready to serve you from A to Z.

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
After leaving Ninh Kieu ferry station, we’ll visit the fruit gardens — also for 1 million VND.

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,500
Before we go, don’t eat anything yet — there are all kinds of delicious fruits waiting for you to try, like duku, durian, mangosteen, longan and more.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If you want to see plaswai, head over to the “cầu tỏm” (yes, that’s really the name), where you’ll see them fighting over food like gladiators.

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,500
And if you want to eat those catfish, just wait a moment — the orchard owner will serve them to you right away.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But be warned: after eating that catfish, you might just throw up your whole family tree — or everything you’ve ever eaten!
