Tariff War 2025: America’s “Liberation Day” — Freeing the World… from Free Trade.

2
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:10,000
In July 2025, the U.S. decided the world needed saving — again.

3
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:14,000
President Trump, back in action, launched Liberation Day: a tariff offensive on 60+ countries.

4
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:18,500
A 10% base tariff on nearly all imports, plus penalties of 25–49% for “unfair traders.”

5
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:23,000
Let’s break down who got hit — and who got smart.

6
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:26,000
China — top of the hit list. Tariffs up to 145%, tech bans, export limits.

7
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:29,500
Message: Don’t mess with the world’s biggest economy. Unless you're the U.S.

8
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:33,000
Vietnam — threatened with 46% tariffs, chose to kneel and deal.

9
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:37,000
Accepted 20%, promised clean customs, opened up to U.S. goods. Smart move.

10
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:41,000
The UK — got lucky. Exemptions on cars and metals.

11
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:45,000
In return? Had to say yes to American beef and ethanol. That’s “special relationship” diplomacy.

12
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:50,000
So who won? The U.S. Treasury — $156 billion in projected tariff revenue.

13
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:54,000
Who lost? American households — paying $1,100 more this year.

14
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:58,500
A court called the tariffs illegal. The White House said: “Security first.”

15
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:03,000
Translation: “We’re in charge. Get over it.”

16
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:07,000
Tariffs in 2025 aren’t taxes — they’re geopolitical power tools.

17
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:11,000
And America’s message is clear: Play by our rules or pay the price.

18
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:14,000
Because nothing says “freedom” like forced compliance.
