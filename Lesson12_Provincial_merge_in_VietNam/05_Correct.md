Provincial Mergers in Vietnam: Opportunities, Challenges, and Practical Outcomes in 2025

In recent years, Vietnam has accelerated administrative reform with the goal of building a streamlined, efficient, and modern state apparatus. One of the most significant policy initiatives implemented in 2025 is the merger of several provincial-level administrative units. This effort aims to enhance governance capacity, reduce public spending, and optimize resource allocation for socio-economic development. It is not merely a technical adjustment but a profound structural transformation that directly affects local governments and millions of citizens. This essay explores the rationale, early results, initial challenges, and long-term prospects of Vietnam’s provincial mergers.

The primary objective of these mergers is to simplify the state administrative system, eliminate overlapping functions, and reduce recurring budget expenditures. Beyond immediate fiscal and organizational benefits, the mergers are expected to improve socio-economic planning across broader territories, strengthen inter-provincial connectivity, and establish major administrative and urban hubs with increased regional and global competitiveness.

According to the 2025 Resolution of the National Assembly, Vietnam officially reduced the number of its provincial-level units to 34, consisting of 28 provinces and 6 centrally governed cities. This restructuring resulted from the consolidation of several existing provinces. Notable examples include the newly formed province of Tuyên Quang, created by merging Tuyên Quang and Hà Giang; Lào Cai, which absorbed Yên Bái; and Thái Nguyên, which merged with Bắc Kạn. In the south, Cần Thơ City became a special-level administrative unit after incorporating Sóc Trăng and Hậu Giang, while Đà Nẵng expanded significantly through its merger with Quảng Nam.

Despite the intended benefits, the initial implementation phase has encountered a range of challenges. First, widespread confusion has emerged among residents regarding new administrative boundaries and place names. Many citizens have faced difficulties in locating appropriate government offices and accessing essential public services. The relocation or consolidation of administrative centers has required some residents to travel longer distances for basic procedures, resulting in delays and public dissatisfaction.

Second, the issue of redundant personnel has become a major concern. Merged provinces often retain overlapping departments and leadership roles, leading to excess staffing. This has caused uncertainty and dissatisfaction among civil servants, particularly those whose positions may be eliminated or redefined. Differences in qualifications, experience, and provincial background have contributed to internal tensions and reduced morale in the public sector.

Cultural and identity-related tensions have also surfaced. Many of the merged provinces are home to distinct ethnic groups, dialects, and traditions. Some communities feel a loss of cultural identity or perceive an imbalance of power—especially when disagreements arise over the naming of the new province or the designation of the provincial capital.

Infrastructure and administrative integration present additional hurdles. Some newly merged provinces now span more than 20,000 square kilometers, yet transportation networks and digital infrastructure remain underdeveloped. This has made it more difficult to deliver government services efficiently. In many cases, legal documents, databases, and identification systems have yet to be fully standardized.

To address these challenges, Vietnam must adopt a well-planned, phased approach to implementation. Transparent public communication is essential to foster understanding and support. Human resource policies should be fair, forward-looking, and include mechanisms to assist displaced employees. Investments in transportation and digital infrastructure must be prioritized to ensure effective governance across expansive regions. Additionally, public consultation in naming new provinces and selecting administrative centers will help build consensus and minimize conflict.

Vietnam’s 2025 provincial mergers represent a bold and transformative step in national administrative reform. By consolidating provincial units, the country seeks to develop a more coherent, efficient, and modern system of governance aligned with its development objectives and global integration goals. While initial challenges are inevitable, strong leadership, transparent policy design, and community engagement will be key to long-term success. If executed properly, the mergers can pave the way for more dynamic regional economies, better public services, and a more resilient state structure capable of meeting the demands of the 21st century.
