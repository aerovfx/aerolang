# Provincial Mergers in Vietnam: Opportunities, Challenges, and Practical Outcomes in 2025

In recent years, Vietnam has accelerated administrative reform with the goal of building a streamlined, effective, and modern state apparatus. One of the most significant policy moves implemented in 2025 is the merger of several provincial-level administrative units. The objective is to enhance governance efficiency, reduce state spending, and optimize resources for socio-economic development. This is not merely a technical adjustment, but a profound structural transformation that directly affects local governments and millions of citizens. This essay examines the rationale, actual results, initial challenges, and long-term prospects of Vietnam’s provincial mergers.

The primary goal of the provincial mergers is to streamline the state administrative system, reduce overlapping functions, and cut down recurrent budget expenditures. Beyond these immediate benefits, the mergers are expected to enable more effective socio-economic planning across larger regions, boost inter-provincial connectivity, and create major administrative and urban hubs with enhanced competitiveness in the region and internationally.

According to the National Assembly’s 2025 Resolution, Vietnam has officially reduced the number of its provincial-level units to **34**, including **28 provinces** and **6 centrally governed cities**. This restructuring came from merging dozens of former provinces into larger entities. Notable examples include the new province of **Tuyên Quang**, formed by merging Tuyên Quang and Hà Giang; **Lào Cai**, merged with Yên Bái; and **Thái Nguyên**, merged with Bắc Kạn. In the south, **Cần Thơ City** has become a special-level administrative unit after merging with Sóc Trăng and Hậu Giang, while **Đà Nẵng** has expanded significantly through its merger with Quảng Nam.

However, the early stages of implementation have encountered several difficulties and challenges. Firstly, there is significant confusion among citizens regarding administrative boundaries and new place names. Many have faced uncertainty in accessing appropriate government offices and services. The relocation or merger of government offices has required people to travel greater distances for essential administrative procedures, leading to delays and inconvenience in daily life.

Secondly, the issue of redundant personnel has become a pressing concern. Merged provinces now have overlapping departments and leadership positions, resulting in an excess of administrative staff. This has triggered dissatisfaction among civil servants, especially those who may lose roles or face unclear job functions. Differences in qualifications, seniority, and provincial backgrounds have also led to morale issues and internal competition within public institutions.

Cultural and identity differences have also surfaced. Many merged provinces contain distinct ethnic groups, dialects, and local traditions. The feeling of “losing identity” or being dominated by a larger partner province has emerged among certain communities, especially when disputes arise over the naming of the new province or the selection of the provincial capital.

Infrastructure and administrative integration pose additional difficulties. Newly merged provinces now span much larger areas—some exceeding 20,000 square kilometers—yet transportation networks and digital infrastructure remain underdeveloped. The lack of smooth connectivity has made it harder for government services to be delivered efficiently, and many legal documents, databases, and identification systems have yet to be fully unified.

To address these issues, Vietnam must adopt a well-planned, phased approach to implementation. Transparent communication with the public is essential to ensure broad understanding and support. Personnel policies must be fair, reasonable, and include mechanisms to support redundant employees. Investment in infrastructure—especially transportation and digital systems—needs to be prioritized to ensure effective governance across wide territories. Finally, the naming of new provinces and the selection of administrative centers should involve public consultation to build consensus and reduce conflict.

Vietnam’s 2025 provincial mergers represent a bold and transformative step in national administrative reform. By consolidating provinces, the country seeks to build a more efficient and modern governance system that aligns with development goals and global integration. Although initial difficulties are inevitable, proper management, transparent policies, and public engagement will be the keys to long-term success. If executed well, the mergers can pave the way for stronger regional economies, more effective public services, and a more resilient state structure capable of adapting to the challenges of the 21st century.
