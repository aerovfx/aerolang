Provincial Mergers in Vietnam: Major Reform with Far-Reaching Impact

Vietnam has officially entered a new phase of administrative reform on an unprecedented scale: merging provinces and cities to streamline the state apparatus, enhance governance efficiency, and reduce public spending.


A Landmark Policy Decision

In June 2025, the National Assembly of Vietnam passed a landmark resolution to reduce the number of provincial-level administrative units from 63 to 34, comprising 28 provinces and 6 centrally governed cities. This was the culmination of years of research, evaluation, and preparation.

The objective of this policy goes beyond simplifying administrative structures—it aims to foster regional connectivity, enable large-scale socio-economic development, and create competitive urban centers capable of integrating into the regional and global landscape.

 Concrete Changes Across Regions

Many localities have undergone the merger process. The new Tuyen Quang province now includes both Tuyen Quang and Ha Giang. Lao Cai has been merged with Yen Bai. Thai Nguyen has united with Bac Kan. In the South, Can Tho City has expanded by merging with Hau Giang and Soc Trang, while Da Nang has integrated with Quang Nam to form a major administrative and economic hub in Central Vietnam.



Opportunities and Challenges Interwoven

While the reform is expected to bring significant breakthroughs, the implementation has raised practical challenges. Changes in administrative boundaries have caused confusion among residents when accessing public services. Personnel redundancy due to overlapping functions, cultural differences between merged provinces, and underdeveloped infrastructure are pressing concerns affecting management and operational efficiency.

 Finding a Path Forward

Experts suggest that to maximize the benefits of this reform, several measures are essential:
	•	Transparent communication to ensure public consensus;
	•	Clear personnel policies, including support for displaced officials;
	•	Strategic investment in transportation and digital infrastructure;
	•	Public consultation on naming and administrative centers to ensure cultural inclusivity and representation.



A Challenge – and an Opportunity

Provincial mergers are more than redrawing administrative maps—they represent a deep restructuring of how the state apparatus is organized and functions. If managed effectively, this reform could be a powerful catalyst for Vietnam’s transition to a more efficient, modern, and sustainable governance model.



Vietnam’s journey of administrative reform is ongoing—and the provincial merger is one of its opening chapters.
