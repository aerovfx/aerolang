**A:** I read about the provincial mergers in Vietnam. It sounds like a major reform.

**B:** Yes, it is. In 2025, Vietnam reduced its provinces from over 60 to just 34.

**A:** Wow. Why did the government decide to merge provinces?

**B:** Mainly to make governance more efficient and reduce public spending. But there are social and logistical reasons, too.

**A:** Can you give some examples of the provinces that were merged?

**B:** Sure. For example, Tuyên Quang and Hà Giang were combined into one province. Also, Cần Thơ City was merged with Sóc Trăng and Hậu Giang to become a special administrative unit.

**A:** Interesting. How have people reacted to these changes?

**B:** Some people are confused, especially with the new boundaries and names. Others are concerned about losing their local identity.

**A:** Do you think the merger will improve public services?

**B:** In theory, yes. But it depends on infrastructure and how well the government integrates the systems.

**A:** Are there any problems with public employees?

**B:** Yes. Redundant staff is a big issue. When departments overlap, not everyone keeps their job.

**A:** That must be difficult. What about culture? Does it affect people?

**B:** Definitely. Some provinces have different ethnic groups and traditions. Merging them can create identity conflicts.

**A:** Can the government do anything to reduce those tensions?

**B:** Public consultation and fair policies could help. Also, involving local communities in decisions is important.

**A:** One last question—what’s your opinion? Is this reform a good idea?

**B:** I think it’s necessary, but it must be done carefully and fairly. If not, it could create more problems than it solves.
