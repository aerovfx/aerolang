Provincial Mergers in Vietnam: Major Reform with Far-Reaching Impact

2  
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:13,000  
Vietnam has officially entered a new phase of administrative reform on an unprecedented scale:

3  
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:19,000  
Merging provinces and cities to streamline the state apparatus, enhance governance efficiency, and reduce public spending.

4  
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:23,000  
A Landmark Policy Decision

5  
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:29,000  
In June 2025, the National Assembly of Vietnam passed a landmark resolution.

6  
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:35,000  
To reduce the number of provincial-level administrative units from 63 to 34:

7  
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:38,000  
Comprising 28 provinces and 6 centrally governed cities.

8  
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:43,000  
This was the culmination of years of research, evaluation, and preparation.

9  
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:49,000  
The objective goes beyond simplifying structures—it aims to foster regional connectivity.

10  
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:54,000  
Enable large-scale socio-economic development,

11  
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:59,000  
And create competitive urban centers that can integrate regionally and globally.

12  
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:02,000  
Concrete Changes Across Regions

13  
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:08,000  
Many localities have undergone the merger process.

14  
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:12,000  
The new Tuyen Quang province now includes both Tuyen Quang and Ha Giang.

15  
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:16,000  
Lao Cai has been merged with Yen Bai.

16  
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:20,000  
Thai Nguyen has united with Bac Kan.

17  
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:26,000  
In the South, Can Tho City has expanded by merging with Hau Giang and Soc Trang.

18  
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:31,000  
Da Nang has integrated with Quang Nam to form a major hub in Central Vietnam.

19  
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:34,000  
Opportunities and Challenges Interwoven

20  
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:39,000  
While the reform is expected to bring significant breakthroughs,

21  
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:44,000  
Implementation has raised practical challenges.

22  
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:49,000  
Changes in administrative boundaries have caused confusion in accessing public services.

23  
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:54,000  
Personnel redundancy due to overlapping functions is a pressing concern.

24  
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:59,000  
So are cultural differences between merged provinces, and underdeveloped infrastructure.

25  
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:03,000  
All of these affect management and operational efficiency.

26  
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:06,000  
Finding a Path Forward

27  
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:10,000  
Experts suggest several essential measures to maximize reform benefits:

28  
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:13,000  
• Transparent communication to ensure public consensus;

29  
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:16,000  
• Clear personnel policies, including support for displaced officials;

30  
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:19,000  
• Strategic investment in transportation and digital infrastructure;

31  
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:23,000  
• Public consultation on naming and administrative centers to ensure inclusivity.

32  
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:27,000  
A Challenge – and an Opportunity

33  
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:32,000  
Provincial mergers are more than redrawing administrative maps—

34  
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:36,000  
They represent a deep restructuring of how the state functions.

35  
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:42,000  
If managed effectively, this reform could be a powerful catalyst for Vietnam’s transition.

36  
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:47,000  
Toward a more efficient, modern, and sustainable governance model.

37  
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:51,000  
Vietnam’s journey of administrative reform is ongoing—

38  
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:55,000  
And the provincial merger is one of its opening chapters.
