**Anna:** In your opinion, do you think money is important in marriage?
**Nam:** Well, in the past, people didn’t **rely on** money. They lived off their land and sold their **crops** only when necessary.
**Anna:** Right, life was more **peaceful** back then. Families enjoyed dinner and talked about the **harvest** and neighbors.
**Nam:** But today, society has **advanced**, and money has become the **measure of a person’s worth**.
**Anna:** Exactly. The rich are respected, while the poor are often **looked down upon**.
**Nam:** And in love, it’s similar. A rich man can **attract** many women. Some no longer care if he really **deserves** respect or not.
**Anna:** That’s sad. Without learning to **appreciate** what we have, couples will **argue** and even get **divorced**.
**Nam:** So true. In the end, many problems come simply because of money.
