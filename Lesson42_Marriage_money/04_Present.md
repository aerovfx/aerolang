In your opinion. Do you think money is important? If there’s no money, can a marriage still be happy?

Over a hundred years ago, people didn’t rely on money. They lived off the products they made from their own land. Whenever they needed money to buy something, they would sell a portion of their crops.

Their lives were peaceful. Families gathered around the dinner table in the evening, eating and talking about the harvest, their neighbors, and simple joys. Oh, how happy they were!

Nowadays, society has advanced. Money has become the measure of a person’s worth. Those with wealth are respected, while the poor are often looked down upon.

The same thing happens in love and marriage. A man with lots of money tends to attract many women. People used to say, “A talented man deserves a beautiful woman,” but today, many women no longer care about talent — as long as the man has money, that’s enough.

In married life, happiness often falls apart because of money. People don’t know how to appreciate the happiness they already have. They argue constantly, even fight, and eventually get divorced.

All because of money.
