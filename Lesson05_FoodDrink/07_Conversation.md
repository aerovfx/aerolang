Conversation: Talking About Food and Eating Habits in Vietnam

A: Hey, how many meals do Vietnamese people usually eat in a day? (WH-question)
B: We normally eat three — breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

A: Do people always eat breakfast early in the morning? (Yes/No question)
B: Not always. People like actors, singers, or night workers usually eat breakfast late, around 10 AM.

A: Oh, so that’s more like brunch, isn’t it? (Tag question)
B: Exactly! It’s a combination of a late breakfast and an early lunch. And some of them even eat again at 11 PM — kind of a late-night snack.

A: That sounds different from Western habits. What’s the Vietnamese diet like? (WH-question)
B: It’s pretty healthy. We don’t eat as much fat as Europeans or Americans. We eat a lot of veggies, fruits, and fish — and not much meat.

A: Who usually eats breakfast at home — rich or poor people? (WH-question with comparison)
B: Poorer families usually eat at home. Richer people tend to go out for breakfast at restaurants or cafes.

A: Doctors say breakfast is the most important meal of the day, right? (Tag question)
B: That’s right! It gives us the energy we need to start the day.

A: Where do workers usually eat lunch? (WH-question)
B: These days, many people eat a light lunch. Workers and government employees often eat at canteens or restaurants because they don’t have time to go home.

A: Is dinner also important in Vietnam? (Yes/No question)
B: Yes, definitely! Dinner is when the whole family gathers. It’s usually around 6 or 7 PM.

A: But I’ve heard some young women skip dinner. Why is that? (WH-question)
B: Because they’re afraid of gaining weight. They say, “It’s easier to get fat than to stay slim.”

A: That’s true. But not everyone can choose, can they? (Tag question)
B: Sadly, no. Some poor people don’t even have enough to eat. They suffer from malnutrition.

A: How much water should we drink every day? (WH-question)
B: At least 2 liters. And we should avoid sugary drinks — they’re bad for our health.

A: Yeah, natural juices and water are better than soda, aren’t they? (Tag question with comparison)
B: For sure! They’re much healthier.
