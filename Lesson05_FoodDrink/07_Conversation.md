üçú Conversation: "Breakfast? Or‚Ä¶ Brunch?"

Lan: Hey Nam, what time did you have breakfast today?

Nam: Uh‚Ä¶ around 10 AM. Actually, I think it was brunch.

Lan: Brunch? Wow, you‚Äôre turning Western now?

Nam: No no, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ I went to bed at 2 AM after watching K-dramas. Blame Netflix!

Lan: Haha! You sound like a pop singer. They always eat late. Night owls!

Nam: Exactly! I'm practically a Vietnamese BTS.

Lan: Keep dreaming! So, what did you eat?

Nam: Just some b√°nh m√¨ with eggs and a bit of fish sauce. You?

Lan: I had ph·ªü. Classic, light, and healthy. You know Vietnamese people eat lots of veggies and fish ‚Äî not fatty burgers like in the West.

Nam: True. Our diet is pretty healthy. But last night, I had snacks at 11 PM. Is that bad?

Lan: Depends. If you're a factory worker, maybe it's okay. If you're a K-drama addict, probably not.

Nam: Haha! So mean! But hey, dinner was at 6, family time. Dad made c√° kho t·ªô. Heaven!

Lan: My mom says young women should skip dinner to stay slim. But skipping meals isn‚Äôt healthy either.

Nam: Yeah, better to eat smart than eat less. Also ‚Äî drink water. At least two liters a day!

Lan: And no sugary sodas!

Nam: Oops‚Ä¶

Lan: What?

Nam: Looks guilty ‚Ä¶I had a Coke with my brunch.

Lan: You need a food intervention!
