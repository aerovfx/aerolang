Actors, actresses, singers, and people who work at night often eat breakfast rather late, around 10 AM. This is called brunch — a combination of a late breakfast and an early lunch. They also tend to eat late-night snacks, sometimes around 11 PM.
Vietnamese eating habits are different from those of Europeans and Americans. We don’t eat a lot of fatty foods. Our diet is quite healthy. We eat a lot of vegetables, fruits, fish, and only a small amount of meat.
Poor families usually have breakfast at home, while wealthier people often eat out at cafés or restaurants. Doctors say that breakfast is really important — it’s the main source of energy for the whole day.

Nowadays, many Vietnamese people have a light lunch. Factory workers and government employees usually eat in the cafeteria or at restaurants because they don’t have time to go home for lunch.

Vietnamese families typically have dinner around 6 or 7 PM. It’s considered family time — a chance for everyone to be together.
Young women often skip dinner at 7 or 8 PM because they’re afraid of gaining weight. They say, “It’s easier to gain weight than to stay slim.” Meanwhile, some poor people don’t even have enough food to eat — they suffer from malnutrition.
We should drink enough water every day — at least 2 liters. We shouldn’t drink sugary sodas because they’re bad for our health.
