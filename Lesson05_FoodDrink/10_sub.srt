Vietnamese people usually have three meals a day — breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,000
Actors, actresses, singers and people who work at night often eat breakfast pretty late, around 10 AM.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,000
It is called a brunch — a mix between a late breakfast and an early lunch.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,000
They often eat late night snacks, sometimes around 11 PM.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,000
Vietnamese people are different from Europeans and Americans. We don’t eat a lot of fatty foods.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,500
Our diet is pretty healthy. We eat a lot of vegetables, fruits, fish and very little meat.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,500
Poor families usually have breakfast at home while wealthier people often eat out at cafes or restaurants.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,500
Doctors say that breakfast is really important — it’s the main source of energy for the whole day.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Nowadays, Vietnamese people often have a light lunch.

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,000
Factory workers and government employees usually eat in the cafeteria or at restaurants because they don’t have time to go home for lunch.

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,000
Vietnamese families usually have dinner around 6 or 7 PM.

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,000
It’s considered family time — a chance for everyone to be together.

13
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,000
Young women often skip dinner at 7 or 8 PM because they’re afraid of gaining weight.

14
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,500
They say, “It’s easier to gain weight than to stay slim.”

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Meanwhile, some poor people don’t even have enough food to eat — they suffer from malnutrition.

16
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,500
We should drink enough water every day — at least 2 liters.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We shouldn’t drink sugary sodas because they’re bad for our health.
