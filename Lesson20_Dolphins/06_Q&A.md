The Power of a Secondhand Laptop

“Sometimes, a dream doesn’t need to be brand new. It just needs to be real.”

Good afternoon, everyone.

Let me tell you about a boy named Tuấn. He lived in a quiet village where rice fields stretch farther than Wi-Fi signals could reach. But Tuấn had a big dream — he wanted to explore the digital world. Not to play games. But to create them.

He had never touched a computer before. His school had only one — and it was locked in the teacher’s room. But every time he passed by a dusty electronics shop in town, he stopped. He stared. He dreamed.

And then… on his 13th birthday, his mother handed him a small box wrapped in old newspaper.
Inside?
A secondhand laptop. A little scratched. A little slow. But to Tuấn… it was magic.

He opened the lid. The screen lit up. And in that moment, his world got bigger.

That night, he didn’t play games.
He typed:
“Thank you, Mom. I’ll use this to learn.”

That little act — that gift — didn’t just give him a tool. It gave him a future.

So let me ask you this:
What would happen if every child had a chance like that?
Not the latest gadget.
Not a perfect device.
Just a door.
A door to knowledge.
A door to hope.

Because sometimes, changing the world doesn’t take billions.
Sometimes, it only takes… one old laptop and a mother’s love.

Thank you.
