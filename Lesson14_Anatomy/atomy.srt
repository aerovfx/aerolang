00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Human anatomy is the scientific study of the structure of the human body,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
from basic parts such as the head, arms, and legs to systems like the skeleton, nervous system, and blood vessels.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Understanding the structure of each part—such as the arms, hands, fingers, legs, and feet—

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
helps explain their functional roles in movement, including walking, grasping, balancing, and coordination.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In modern medicine, anatomy forms the foundation of all clinical specialties.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Doctors must clearly understand the location of organs, nerves, and blood vessels

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
in order to diagnose, treat, and perform surgeries safely.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Techniques such as endoscopy, MRI, or robotic surgery

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
rely on precise anatomical knowledge to intervene effectively and with minimal invasiveness.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Especially for motor-related parts like the upper and lower limbs,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
anatomy is essential in rehabilitation, orthopedics, and trauma care.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
In visual arts, anatomical knowledge enables painters, sculptors, and character designers

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
to understand human proportions, muscle distribution, and realistic movement.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Classical artworks from the Renaissance to the present reflect deep knowledge of the human form,

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
expressed through lifelike poses and authentic emotions.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
In traditional Eastern medicine, although the body is not dissected as in Western practice,

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
there exists a well-developed theoretical system describing the functions of organs, blood flow, and energy channels.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Acupuncture is a specific application of anatomy from the Eastern perspective.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Acupoints are distributed across the body, especially in the head, arms, legs, feet, back, and chest.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
For instance, the Hegu point, located between the thumb and index finger,

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
is used to treat headaches and fevers.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The Zusanli point, below the knee, boosts digestion and immunity;

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and the Neiguan point, on the forearm, calms the mind and relieves nausea.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Although the theories differ, modern research shows many acupoints correspond to nerve and blood vessel intersections,

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
suggesting a connection between Eastern medicine and anatomical science.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Human anatomy is a key to unlocking deep understanding of the body,

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
serving healing, artistic creation, and health preservation in both modern and traditional approaches.
