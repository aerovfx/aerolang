00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Tsunamis — just the name sounds like a drama queen with a grudge.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:12,000
Somehow, humans — the only species smart enough to build beachfront villas — act totally shocked when the ocean decides to crash the party.

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:18,000
We build our dream homes “with an ocean view,” then scream bloody murder when the ocean takes a peek inside.

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,000
Nature isn’t evil — it just really hates being ignored.

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:29,000
Scientists say, “Don’t reclaim land from the sea.” Developers say, “But what about the oceanfront resort?”

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:38,000
So one sunny day, the tsunami rolls in — no invitation, no warning (well, technically there was), just a casual, “Sorry folks, I was here before you had deeds.”

7
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,000
To be fair, tsunamis are polite in their own way.

8
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,000
They come with alarms, flashing alerts, and scrolling red warnings.

9
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:51,000
But instead of running, people whip out their phones: “OMG guys look! The water’s rising!”

10
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,000
And the next thing you know, their video is part of a rescue team briefing.

11
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,000
Let’s be real: the tsunami isn’t the villain.

12
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:03,000
It’s just doing its job — reminding us that nature is not some theme park.

13
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:10,000
So if you’re still dreaming of building that 5-star hotel right on the edge of the surf… at least know how to swim.

14
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:15,000
Don’t mess with Mother Nature. When she claps back, it’s not gonna be cute.
