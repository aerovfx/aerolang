00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
A wedding ceremony is one of the most important events in a couple’s life when they want to get married.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:12,000
Brides and grooms usually hold their wedding ceremony at home or at a restaurant.

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:18,000
They invite relatives, family members and friends to witness and share the joy of this happy day.

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:25,000
Among those present at the party, some of them are truly happy: the bride, groom and their parents.

5
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:31,000
Others may appear cheerful, but in reality, they are quietly sad.

6
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:36,000
They are the guests, because their salaries are limited and they have to attend too many wedding ceremonies in the same month.

7
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:42,000
After the wedding ceremony, the bride and groom usually travel somewhere for their honeymoon.

8
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:48,000
Rich couples travel abroad or to some famous places.

9
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:54,000
Poor couples have to honeymoon at home, or sometimes don’t have one at all,

10
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,000
because they have to work hard to pay off wedding debt.

11
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:04,000
But sadly, only a few couples can keep their happiness until the end of life.

12
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:10,000
Most others have to say goodbye just a few years after the wedding ceremony.

13
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,000
That’s modern life!
