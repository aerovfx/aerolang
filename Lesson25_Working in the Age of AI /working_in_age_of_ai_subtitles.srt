Back in the day, manual labor was honorable. Today? “Artificial Intelligence labor” is the new cool.

00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:13,000
We’ve entered an era where robots can code, AIs can paint, and humans… are busy signing up for emotional intelligence workshops.

00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:20,000
We thought AI would replace factory workers — turns out, it's coming for designers, programmers, journalists, even poets.

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,000
Some folks wake up jobless, not because they did anything wrong, but because a smarter, faster algorithm just moved in.

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:32,000
Never before have we had to compete with something that doesn’t sleep, doesn’t eat, and never asks for a raise.

00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:38,000
While AI learns in one night what takes us ten years, we still need two cups of coffee just to open Excel.

7
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:45,000
The irony? We built AI to make our lives easier… and now we’re scrambling to take AI courses just to stay employed.

00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:50,000
Welcome to the 4.0 life: if you don’t upgrade yourself, you’ll be uninstalled.

9
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,000
AI isn’t scary. What’s scary is using an analog mindset in a world running on digital logic.
