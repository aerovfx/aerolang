00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000  
Jurassic World: Rebirth brings a fresh twist to the franchise, with Scarlett Johansson playing Zora Bennett — a scientist recruited for a groundbreaking genetic project involving dinosaurs and medical innovation.

2  
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:10,000  
Set in a world where dinosaurs coexist with humans, a biotech company engineers the D-Rex, a creature with regenerative powers meant for healing — until things inevitably go wrong.

3  
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:14,000  
The film’s greatest strength lies in its visuals.

4  
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:18,000  
The dinosaurs, especially the mutated D-Rex, are impressively lifelike.

5  
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:23,000  
Action scenes across jungles, cities, and the creature’s lair are stunning and full of scale.

6  
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:28,000  
Unfortunately, the script doesn’t match the visuals.

7  
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:34,000  
Though the film hints at big ideas — like bioethics and genetic responsibility — these are explored only superficially.

8  
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:38,000  
The plot rushes from action to action, offering little character development.

9  
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:42,000  
Zora’s internal conflict as a scientist is barely addressed.

10  
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:46,000  
The pacing is solid but lacks emotional highs or memorable twists, leaving the film visually engaging but emotionally flat.

11  
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:51,000  
Despite its flaws, Rebirth delivers as a popcorn blockbuster — fun for fans of dinosaur thrills, but not for those seeking depth or innovation.

12  
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:54,000
