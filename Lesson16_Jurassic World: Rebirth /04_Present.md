Movie Review: Jurassic World – Rebirth (2025)

“Jurassic World: Rebirth” is the latest installment in the long-running Jurassic franchise, marking a bold shift in both casting and storytelling. The film features Scarlett Johansson in the role of Zora Bennett — a brilliant scientist recruited for a genetic mission involving dinosaurs and pharmaceutical innovation.

The story starts with an intriguing premise: dinosaurs are no longer mere wild creatures to be contained but have become biological resources for gene research and medical breakthroughs. In a world where dinosaurs coexist with humans, a biotech corporation creates a genetically engineered creature — the D-Rex — with regenerative capabilities, hoping to harness it for human healing. As expected, things spiral out of control.

In terms of visual effects, the film delivers spectacularly. The dinosaurs are realistic and detailed, with creative design, especially the mutated D-Rex. Action sequences set in tropical rainforests, urban environments, and the creature’s lair are visually stunning. This remains one of the franchise’s strongest assets — delivering tension and scale on the big screen.

However, the script is clearly the film’s weakest point. While the movie introduces promising themes — bioethics, the human-nature relationship, and the dangers of genetic manipulation — they are addressed only superficially. The plot moves quickly from one action scene to another, leaving little room for character development or moral conflict. Scarlett Johansson’s character, Zora, despite her strong screen presence, is given limited material to explore emotional depth or philosophical tension. Her inner struggle as a scientist between discovery and responsibility is barely touched.

The pacing is steady but lacks emotional high points or memorable twists. Some scenes hint at potential turning points but are rushed or resolved too easily. As a result, the viewing experience is visually satisfying but emotionally flat.

Still, the film works well as a mainstream blockbuster, especially for fans of dinosaur action and thrilling chase sequences. It doesn’t ask for much reflection, nor does it promise groundbreaking storytelling. If you’re looking for pure entertainment with top-tier effects and a familiar Jurassic vibe, Rebirth will likely satisfy.
