1  
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000  
Jurassic World: Rebirth brings a fresh twist to the franchise.

2  
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:08,000  
Scarlett Johansson plays Zora Bennett — a scientist on a genetic project.

3  
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:13,000  
She’s recruited for research involving dinosaurs and medical innovation.

4  
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:18,000  
In a world where dinosaurs coexist with humans, chaos begins.

5  
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:22,000  
A biotech firm creates the D-Rex, designed to heal — but it backfires.

6  
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:26,000  
The film’s greatest strength lies in its visuals.

7  
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:30,000  
The dinosaurs, especially the mutated D-Rex, are impressively lifelike.

8  
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:34,000  
Action scenes in jungles, cities, and lairs are stunning and epic.

9  
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:38,000  
Unfortunately, the script doesn’t match the visual quality.

10  
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:42,000  
Themes like bioethics and genetic responsibility are barely explored.

11  
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:46,000  
The story jumps between action scenes with minimal character development.

12  
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:50,000  
Zora’s internal struggle as a scientist is barely addressed.

13  
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:54,000  
The pacing is steady but lacks emotional highs or twists.

14  
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:58,000  
It’s visually engaging but emotionally flat.

15  
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:02,000  
Still, Rebirth succeeds as a popcorn blockbuster.

16  
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:06,000  
It’s fun for fans of dinosaur thrills and big effects.

17  
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:10,000  
But it doesn’t offer depth or innovation.

18  
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:13,000  
Review Summary — Strengths: visuals, dinosaurs, action, Johansson.

19  
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:16,000  
Weaknesses: weak script, shallow themes, low emotional impact.

20  
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:20,000  
Rating: 6.8/10 – Eye-catching and entertaining, but lacking depth.
