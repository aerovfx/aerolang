Phuoc Buu Town, October 11th, 2019

00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,000
My dearest love,

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,000
How are you and your family? What are you doing these days?

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,500
Are you working today or staying at home?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I wonder… do you ever whisper my name to yourself—whether in joy or in sorrow?

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,000
As my family and I, we’re all doing fine. Mom, Dad, and my siblings often speak of you.

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,000
But deep inside, I still feel sad… because I miss you.

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,000
Vietnam’s traditional Lunar New Year is coming soon—only 25 days left!

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,500
Our Tet holiday is very different from the American New Year.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Like the Chinese, we celebrate the Lunar New Year.

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,000
This year, Tet falls on January 25th, 2020 (solar calendar), which is also the 1st day of the Year of the Rat.

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,000
I’ve never celebrated Tet in America, so I don’t know what your New Year is like.

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,500
But Tet in Vietnam is always joyful and full of warmth.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
During Tet, family members from all over return to gather under the same roof. Everyone is busy.

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,000
My father decorates the house and garden. My mother makes bánh chưng.

16
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,500
A square sticky rice cake filled with mung beans and pork.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I go to the market to buy cakes, fruits, food, and vegetables. My siblings clean the house.

18
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,000
Each of us has our own task.

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:37,000
In the evening, my whole family gathers around the fire, watching over the pot of bánh chưng...

20
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,000
...while sharing stories from the past and present. The Tet atmosphere is so warm and cozy.

21
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,000
On New Year’s Eve, no one in my family sleeps. We sit together, watch the apricot blossoms blooming...

22
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,000
...waiting for that sacred moment to arrive, when the old year has just passed and the new year begins.

23
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,500
My beloved,

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Everyone in my family is joyful and excited. They all seem so content.

25
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:08,000
But as for me, there’s still something missing. It causes me deep, quiet pain—but also intense longing.

26
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes… it’s yourself.

27
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,000
How can I be truly happy without you? Loving you brings me so much happiness...

28
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,000
...because you’ve filled my life with joy. And yet, loving you also brings me immense sorrow…

29
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
...because I fear losing you.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I wish you could be here with me this Tet. The both of us would…

31
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,500
Oh dear, I feel breathless just imagining it.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I’d better stop here.

33
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,500
It’s already past midnight.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,500
Please take good care of yourself, okay?

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And send my warmest regards to your parents and siblings.

36
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Lots of love

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Your little sweetheart,
