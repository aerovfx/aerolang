Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Game Designer position at NCsoft. With a multidisciplinary background in digital art, programming, and animation, I bring a unique blend of technical skill and creative vision that aligns well with your mission to deliver groundbreaking, culturally rich gaming experiences.

Currently, I work as a Technical Artist, where I bridge the gap between art and engineering. My daily responsibilities involve optimizing assets for real-time performance, building animation systems, and collaborating closely with both artists and developers to ensure cohesive visual storytelling. This role has helped me develop a holistic view of the game development pipeline and a strong sensitivity to both player experience and system performance.

Over the past two years, I’ve also led several independent game projects using Unity and C#, including a 2D platformer that won second place at the Vietnam Indie Game Jam 2024. I have a strong grasp of Southeast Asian cultural motifs and enjoy crafting experiences that are emotionally resonant and technically polished.

What draws me to NCsoft is your proven ability to create AAA titles with exceptional artistic quality and immersive world-building. Your characters feel truly alive—emotionally complex, visually striking, and deeply embedded in their narratives. Titles such as [Game Title] stand out not only for their technical excellence but for their ability to evoke strong emotional connections with players. That balance between cutting-edge technology and compelling storytelling is exactly what I hope to contribute to and grow within.

What sets me apart is my broad foundation in fine arts—from traditional painting and character design to procedural animation pipelines—which allows me to approach game systems with both an artistic and technical lens. I believe this intersection is essential to modern game design, especially in narrative-driven, immersive worlds.

I would love the opportunity to bring my experience, curiosity, and collaborative spirit to NCsoft’s visionary team. I am available for an interview at your convenience and can be reached at [Your Email] or [Your Phone Number].

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,
[Your Full Name]
