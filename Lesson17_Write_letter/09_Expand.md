(Viết đơn xin việc ở công ty game)

In recent years, the video game industry has become one of the fastest-growing and most exciting fields in the world. Game companies are not only looking for talented developers and designers, but also creative storytellers, sharp marketers, data analysts, and passionate gamers.

Before writing the application, it’s essential to research the company. What kinds of games do they create? Are they focused on mobile, PC, or console games? Do they emphasize competitive e-sports, casual games, or story-driven experiences? Understanding the company’s vision and values helps you tailor your cover letter more effectively.

2. Structure of a Game Job Application Letter

	•	Introduction: Briefly introduce yourself and mention the position you’re applying for.
	•	Why You’re a Good Fit: Highlight your relevant skills (programming, design, writing, testing, etc.) and your passion for gaming.
	•	Knowledge of the Company: Show that you understand their products and explain why you want to be part of their team.
	•	Closing Paragraph: Express your hope for an interview and provide your contact information.
