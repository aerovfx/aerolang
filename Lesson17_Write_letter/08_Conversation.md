Visa Interview Script (Tourist Visa – B2 or Family Visit)

Visa Officer (VO): Good morning. What’s the purpose of your trip to the United States?

Anh Tuyet: Good morning. I would like to visit my loved one in the U.S. during the New Year season and experience how Americans celebrate the holiday. I’ve never spent Tet — our Vietnamese Lunar New Year — abroad before, and I really want to understand how it feels to welcome the new year with someone I care deeply about, in his culture.

⸻

VO: Who are you going to visit?

Anh Tuyet: I’m going to visit my boyfriend. We’ve been in a long-distance relationship for quite a while. He lives in the U.S. with his family, and we often write letters and video call each other. This trip is very meaningful to both of us.

⸻

VO: When do you plan to travel?

Anh Tuyet: I’d like to travel around mid-January and stay for about three weeks. That way, I can be with him during both Tet in Vietnam and the Western New Year in America.

⸻

VO: What do you plan to do during your visit?

Anh Tuyet: I want to spend time with his family, learn about American culture, and introduce him to Vietnamese Tet traditions. I’ll bring traditional items like dried fruits and maybe even help cook dishes like bánh chưng, a special sticky rice cake we make every Tet.

⸻

VO: Have you traveled abroad before?

Anh Tuyet: Not yet, this would be my first time. That’s why I’m very excited and also a little nervous. But I’ve prepared everything carefully.

⸻

VO: How will you support yourself financially during this trip?

Anh Tuyet: I have savings from my job here in Vietnam, and my boyfriend will also support some of the expenses while I’m there. I can show you my bank statement if needed.

⸻

VO: Do you intend to stay in the U.S. permanently?

Anh Tuyet: No, I love my home and my family in Vietnam deeply. Tet is a time for family reunion, and we have strong traditions. I will absolutely return to Vietnam after my visit. My parents, siblings, and my job are all waiting for me.

⸻

VO: What do you do in Vietnam?

Anh Tuyet: I work in my hometown, Phước Bửu. I help my family, especially during busy seasons like Tet. My parents rely on me for shopping, house chores, and preparation for family gatherings.

⸻

VO: Why now?

Anh Tuyet: Because Tet is coming very soon — it’s a very emotional time for me. I wrote a letter recently saying that even though everything is joyful here, something still feels missing — I miss him. I think visiting him now, even for a short time, would give me precious memories to carry back home.

⸻

VO: What will you do when you come back?

Anh Tuyet: I’ll continue supporting my family and working. I also hope to share with them what I learned about New Year traditions in the U.S. — maybe even start some new ones here!

⸻

VO: Thank you. That’s all I need to know.

Anh Tuyet: Thank you so much for your time and consideration.
