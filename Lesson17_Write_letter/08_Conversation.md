Anh Tuyết:
Hey love, how are you and your family these days? Are you working today, or relaxing at home?

Người yêu:
We’re doing fine. I went to work earlier, just got back. And you? I’ve been missing you.

Anh Tuyết:
I miss you too… a lot. Mom, Dad, and my siblings often talk about you. But honestly, I feel a little sad. I just… feel incomplete without you.

Người yêu:
I know… I feel the same. I wish I could be there with you.

Anh Tuyết:
Tết is coming soon—only 25 days left! It’s so different from the New Year you celebrate in America. Ours is based on the lunar calendar, like the Chinese.

Người yêu:
Right! So this year, when is it?

Anh Tuyết:
It falls on January 25th. It’s also the first day of the Year of the Rat.

Người yêu:
Wow, I’ve never had a Vietnamese Tết before. What’s it like?

Anh Tuyết:
It’s beautiful and warm. Family members return from everywhere. We all get busy—Dad decorates, Mom makes bánh chưng, I go shopping, and my siblings clean the house.

Người yêu:
That sounds so cozy and meaningful.

Anh Tuyết:
Yes, in the evening we gather around the fire, watching over the bánh chưng pot, telling old and new stories. On New Year’s Eve, no one sleeps—we just wait for the sacred moment when the year changes.

Người yêu:
I wish I could be with you then.

Anh Tuyết:
Me too… Everyone here is happy. But I still feel something’s missing. It’s you.

Người yêu:
That’s how I feel too. Loving you brings me joy… but also fear. I’m scared of losing you.

Anh Tuyết:
If only we could spend this Tết together… just the two of us.

Người yêu:
Someday we will. I promise.

Anh Tuyết:
It’s already past midnight here. Take care of yourself, okay? Please send my love to your family.

Người yêu:
I will. Sweet dreams, my little sweetheart.
