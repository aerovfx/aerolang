Drones – Flying Cameras with No Conscience

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,000
Once upon a time, the sky belonged to birds and clouds.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,000
Today? It’s the playground of drones — robotic birds that don’t sleep, don’t chirp,

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,000
and don’t care if you’re in your pajamas on the balcony.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,000
At first, drones were a tech dream: wedding shoots on mountaintops, beach resorts, home deliveries.

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:28,000
But in just a few years, they’ve become sky paparazzi, reluctant couriers, and sometimes… anonymous spies.

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:33,000
Tech fans say drones represent “freedom in the air.”

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,000
In reality, they make you want to hang a “Private airspace” sign in your backyard.

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:42,000
You go on a picnic — a drone follows. You watch the sunrise — a drone livestreams it first.

10
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:47,000
And in the wrong hands, a drone becomes a way to “share moments” — without your consent.

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,000
In rural areas, drones spray pesticides.

12
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,000
In the city, they deliver bubble tea.

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,000
In war zones, they offer “condolences via GPS.”

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,000
Yes — from toys to photographers to airborne threats — drones do it all.

15
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,000
And who controls them? A 17-year-old on a rooftop? A government far away?

16
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,000
The sky seems peaceful — but only because you can’t hear a camera zooming in.

17
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,500
Drones are convenient. Too bad they don’t come with a conscience.
