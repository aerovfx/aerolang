1  
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000  
September 2 isn’t just a day off —  
it’s a day when an entire nation remembers a defining moment in history.

2  
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,000  
When President Ho Chi Minh declared Vietnam’s independence,  
boldly announcing to the world…

3  
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,000  
…that we are a free and sovereign people  
who will never be conquered.

4  
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,000  
We take pride in a nation that, though small in size,  
defeated mighty empires through sheer determination.

5  
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,000  
From epic victories in war  
to resilient growth in peace,

6  
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,000  
our ancestors left behind a legacy of greatness  
written in blood, courage, and sacrifice.

7  
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,000  
But today’s youth aren’t here to simply enjoy the fruits of peace —  
we’re here to carry the torch.

8  
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,000  
Inventing technologies,  
winning global competitions,  
building products proudly labeled “Made in Vietnam”...

9  
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,000  
Every achievement is a modern continuation  
of that patriotic spirit.

10  
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,000  
This year’s national concept could be:

11  
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,000  
“Rooted in Pride – Rising to the Future”

12  
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,000  
Our ancestors wrote history with valor.  
Now it’s our turn —  
to write the future with innovation and courage.

13  
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,000  
So that Vietnam may forever stand tall  
on the global stage.
