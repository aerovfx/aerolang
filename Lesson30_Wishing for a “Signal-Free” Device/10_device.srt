1  
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000  
Back in the day, communication was simple:  
walkie-talkies, radio calls, or just knocking on someone’s door.

2  
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,000  
No SIM cards, no data plans,  
and definitely no “temporarily out of service due to unpaid bills.”

3  
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,000  
Fast forward to now: we’re hyper-connected — but totally dependent.

4  
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,000  
Want to send a text? You need 4G.  
Want to make a call? Better hope your plan is active.

5  
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,000  
Skip topping up your balance for a month,  
and your phone becomes a very expensive paperweight.

6  
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,000  
We live in a world of instant messaging and video calls,  
yet everything runs through a digital tollbooth.

7  
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,000  
Just to say “hi” to a friend,  
you have to ask permission from your data provider.

8  
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,000  
Want to call Mom? Check your balance first.  
Want to share Wi-Fi? Plug in that fiber cable.

9  
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,000  
So, some of us tech dreamers are starting to crave a new kind of device —  
one that operates off the grid.

10  
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,000  
No SIMs, no carriers, no infrastructure strings attached.

11  
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,000  
Something like a modern walkie-talkie  
with 6G capabilities and a slick dark mode UI.

12  
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,000  
Fully free-range communication.

13  
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,000  
In a world where every connection is mediated,  
we’re longing for something primal.

14  
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,000  
Communication without conditions,  
without fees, and without middlemen.

15  
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,000  
Just two humans who genuinely want to talk.
