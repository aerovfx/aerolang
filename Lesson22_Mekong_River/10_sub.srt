00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
There are four famous rivers in the world: 
the Amazon in South America, the Nile in Africa, 
the Mekong in Asia, and the Mississippi in North America.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:12,000
The Mekong River is the third largest, stretching 4,880 km. 
It begins in the Tibetan Highlands in China 
and flows through six countries: 
China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam.

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:17,500
From Cambodia, after flowing through the border into Vietnam, 
the Mekong River splits into nine branches like nine dragons, 
all pouring into the East Sea.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,500
That’s why it’s called the “Cửu Long River,” 
which means “River of Nine Dragons.”

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,500
The Mekong plays an incredibly important role 
for the people of southern Vietnam, 
especially in the Mekong Delta region.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,000
The river not only provides fertile land and rice for the nation, 
but also supplies seafood for all of southern Vietnam.

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,500
It helps millions of people earn a living in the areas it flows through.  
What a wonderful river!

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,000
But now, will the Mekong River someday become just a legend?

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,500
From the beginning of the Mekong to Cambodia, 
nineteen hydroelectric dams have been built.

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,500
The river is being destroyed!

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,000
There is no more alluvium, no more fish or shrimp.  
Rice fields are contaminated with salt.

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,500
People in the Mekong Delta are facing hunger and thirst.  
Millions have been forced to leave their homes in search of a way to survive.

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,000
While the world is crying out to protect the river,  
we are destroying the rivers in our own country.
