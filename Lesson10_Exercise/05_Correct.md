Those who work hard every day with their hands don’t need to exercise — for example, farmers, blacksmiths, janitors, or bricklayers. What they want after a hard-working day is to come home and relax.

Those who do brain-based work, like students, secretaries, or businessmen, have to exercise because they don’t get much physical activity in their jobs.

Exercising is very important for health. If we don’t use our muscles, they will weaken, our bodies will become obese, and many diseases will affect us.

We have many choices for doing exercise. We can play sports like tennis, ping pong, badminton, or football. Girls can do lighter sports like dancing, aerobic exercise, or yoga.

Jogging is the cheapest sport. It is suitable for everyone. We can jog in the early morning or late afternoon. People say, “A sound mind is always in a strong and energetic body.”

Do you want to prolong your life or shorten it?
Do you want the road to the cemetery from your house to be long or short?
That depends on your choice.
