Lesson 3: Weather
Vietnam is located in a tropical climate zone, so the weather is usually hot and rainy. In the North, there are four seasons: spring, summer, fall and winter. The summer is very hot, while the winter can be quite cold. Occasionally, it even snows in the mountains, like in the Hoang Lien Son range or in Sapa.

Autumn is when the leaves turn yellow or red. Dry leaves fall and rustle along the streets, in neighborhoods and in parks.

Autumn in the North is truly beautiful. It often inspires poets and artists.

In the spring, flowers bloom everywhere. In Northern Vietnam, spring is the season of festivals and a time when young men and women go out on dates.

In Southern Vietnam, there are only two seasons: the dry season and the rainy season.

The dry season starts in late November and ends in early May.

On the other hand, the rainy season begins in early May and lasts until the end of November.

In the South, it usually rains in the afternoon or evening. Unlike the North, the South rarely experiences storms.

The climate in Southern Vietnam is mild and not extreme, which is why Southern people are often seen as friendly and easygoing.
