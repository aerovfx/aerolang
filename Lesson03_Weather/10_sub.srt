1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Vietnam is in a tropical climate zone, so the weather is usually hot and rainy.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,000
In the North, there are four seasons: spring, summer, fall and winter.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,000
The summer is very hot, while the winter can be quite cold.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,000
Occasionally, it even snows on the mountains, like in the Hoang Lien Son range or in Sapa.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,000
In the Autumn, the leaves turn into yellow or red.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,000
Dead leaves fall along the streets, in neighborhoods and in parks.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,500
Autumn in the North is truly beautiful.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It often inspires poets and artists.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,000
In the spring, flowers bloom everywhere.

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:47,000
In Northern Vietnam, spring is the season of festivals and a time for beautiful girls and handsome boys go out to dates.

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,500
In South Vietnam, there are only two seasons: the dry season and the wet season.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The dry season begins in late November and ends in early May.

13
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,000
On the other hand, the wet season begins in early May and lasts until the end of November.

14
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,000
In the South, it usually rains in the afternoon or evening.

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,000
Unlike the North, there are rarely storms in the South.

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,000
The climate in Southern Vietnam is mild and not severe,

17
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,000
that is why Southern people are often seen as friendly and easygoing (sociable).
