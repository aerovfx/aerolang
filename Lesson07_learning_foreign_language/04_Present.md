Learning Foreign Languages

In Saigon, there are thousands of foreign language centers and schools. We can learn English, French, German, Japanese, Korean, or Chinese if we like.

Most learners study foreign languages at night when they are free. During the day, they have to work to earn a living. They hope that if they can speak a language well, they will have a chance to find a better job.

In the evening, thousands of people flock to language centers. It is said that you can understand a nation’s people when you can speak their language.

That is absolutely true. But learning a language is not easy at all. At the beginning of the course, many people register, but by the end, many have dropped out because it is too difficult.

The most important thing is patience—nothing is impossible if you are determined.
Today, you may not be able to speak yet, but tomorrow, next week, or next month… surely you will.

Stay optimistic! I wish you success.
And remember: On the road to success, there are no footprints of the lazy ones.
