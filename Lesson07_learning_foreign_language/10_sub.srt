00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In Saigon, there are thousands of foreign language centers and schools.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,000
You can learn English, French, German, Japanese, Korean, or Chinese if you wish.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,000
Most learners study foreign languages at night when they are free, as they have to work during the day to earn a living.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,000
They hope that by speaking a foreign language well, they will have a better chance of finding a good job.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,000
In the evenings, thousands of people flock to language centers.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,000
It is said that you can truly understand a nation’s people when you can speak their language.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,500
This is absolutely true.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
However, learning a language is not easy.

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,000
At the beginning of a course, many people register, but by the end, many have dropped out because it is too difficult.

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,000
The most important thing is patience—nothing is impossible if you are determined.

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,000
Today, you may not be able to speak yet, but tomorrow, next week, or next month… surely you will.

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,500
Stay optimistic! I wish you success.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And remember: On the road to success, there are no footprints of the lazy ones.
