1  
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000  
These days, eating isn’t just about staying alive — it’s a declaration.

2  
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,000  
What you put on your plate can reveal your tribe:  
Team Meat or Team Greens, Team Detox or Team “More Fish Sauce, Please.”

3  
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,500  
Some go vegetarian as a spiritual path. Some, because it’s trending.

4  
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,000  
Others simply because they posted “starting a greener life” on Facebook last night —  
and now every meal comes with hashtags like #HealthyLife and #MeatFreeMonday…

5  
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,500  
…even if they just dreamed of being chased by fried chicken in the park.

6  
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,000  
On the other side, hardcore meat lovers treat salad like it’s contagious.

7  
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,500  
Their go-to line: “How can raw vegetables be enough?”  
— said while biting into a juicy pork belly skewer, chased with a sugary soda.

8  
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,000  
But here’s the truth: Vegetables aren’t saints, and meat isn’t the devil.

9  
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,000  
A stir-fried plate of pesticide-loaded veggies cooked in cheap reused oil  
isn’t exactly pure and holy.

10  
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,000  
Just as a factory-marinated frozen pork chop from last year  
won’t lead you to nutritional salvation either.

11  
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,500  
On the other hand, a free-range chicken — fed natural grains,  
allowed to run around in the sun —

12  
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,000  
— could be more nourishing than tofu deep-fried  
in oil that’s seen better decades.

13  
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,500  
If it’s natural, it’s good — whether it grows on a branch or walks on legs.

14  
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,000  
The problem isn’t whether you eat meat or plants.  
The real question is: do you even know what you’re eating?

15  
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,000  
Where did it come from? How was it grown or raised?

16  
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,000  
Because it’s laughable to debate the ethics of eating meat…  
while chewing on a soy sausage made from seventeen different lab-born ingredients.

17  
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,000  
And just as absurd to brag about “meaty strength”  
without knowing the difference between wild-caught fish and farm-raised ones swimming in antibiotics.

18  
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,000  
At the end of the day, your body doesn’t need a belief system — it needs real food.

19  
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,000  
Diversity. Balance.  
Ingredients that come from soil or sea, not slogans.

20  
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,000  
So whether you’re vegan or carnivore, remember this:

21  
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,000  
There’s nothing more dangerous than blind faith in a plate  
that looks “moral” but isn’t even healthy.
