00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Every year, we have many holidays, but the most important one for Vietnamese people is Tet Holiday.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,500
While Europeans and Americans celebrate the Gregorian New Year, Vietnamese people celebrate the Lunar New Year.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Regardless of religion, age, or financial status—whether old or young, rich or poor—everyone enjoys Tet Holiday.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:23,000
On the day before Tet, everyone is busy cleaning their house and garden, and decorating their home.

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,500
Mothers are often busy shopping for food, cakes, fruits, and more.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,500
Children help their parents tidy up the house and wash dishes. Everyone has his own tasks.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The symbolic flower in Southern Vietnam is the apricot blossom, while in Northern Vietnam it is the peach blossom.

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,500
Therefore, southern Vietnamese buy apricot blossoms, and northern Vietnamese buy peach blossoms to decorate their homes for Tet.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In New Year's Eve, no one is asleep.

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,000
Family members gather around the fire to watch the pot of square sticky rice cakes cooking and share stories of the past and present.

11
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,000
On the first day of the Lunar New Year, adults visit relatives and friends to offer New Year wishes.

12
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,000
Children wear new clothes and receive lucky money in red envelopes.

13
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,000
Rich people often travel to famous places, while poorer families celebrate Tet in their own neighborhoods.

14
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,000
However, no one feels sad or disappointed.

15
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,000
Tet is considered a time for family—an opportunity for everyone to be together, reflect on family traditions, and celebrate Vietnamese customs.
