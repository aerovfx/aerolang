**Emily**: Hi Linh! I’ve heard a lot about Tet. Can you tell me what it’s all about?

**Linh**: Of course! Tet is the Vietnamese Lunar New Year. It’s the most important holiday in Vietnam.

**Emily**: Oh, like New Year’s Eve in the U.S.?

**Linh**: Kind of! But we celebrate it based on the lunar calendar, so it usually falls in late January or early February. It’s a time for family reunions and honoring ancestors.

**Emily**: Sounds meaningful! What do people usually do to prepare?

**Linh**: A lot! We clean our houses to sweep away bad luck, buy new clothes, and decorate with flowers—apricot blossoms in the South and peach blossoms in the North.

**Emily**: That’s interesting. Are there special foods too?

**Linh**: Yes! We eat *banh chung* – a square sticky rice cake with pork and mung beans. We also have candied fruits, pickled vegetables, and lots of traditional dishes.

**Emily**: Yum! What happens on New Year’s Eve?

**Linh**: Families stay up late, gather around the fire, and watch the pot of *banh chung* boiling. We tell stories and enjoy the moment together.

**Emily**: And what about the children?

**Linh**: Kids wear new clothes and receive lucky money in red envelopes. It’s everyone’s favorite part!

**Emily**: I’d love to experience Tet one day.

**Linh**: You should! Tet is not just a holiday—it’s part of our culture and identity.
