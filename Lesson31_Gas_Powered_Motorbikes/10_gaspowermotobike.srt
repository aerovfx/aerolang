1  
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000  
From Taiwan to Shanghai, governments aren’t yelling “Ban gas bikes now!” —  

2  
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,000  
They’re whispering sweetly:  
“We’ll slowly persuade you to let go of that dear old scooter…”

3  
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,000  
…with cash, perks, and just enough infrastructure  
so you won’t complain too loudly.

4  
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,000  
In Taiwan, electric bikes are seduced with VIP license plates,  
special parking spots, discounts, and subsidies.

5  
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,000  
In Shanghai, officials took a firmer approach:  
no more license plates for gas bikes, no renewals,

6  
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,000  
and mandatory “retirement” after 13 years  
or 120,000 km — whichever comes first.

7  
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,000  
And it’s not just about banning —  
they’ll even buy back your old ride.

8  
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,000  
Hand you a free metro pass,  
build battery-swap stations for delivery riders,

9  
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,000  
and roll out metro lines faster  
than you can say “pollution.”

10  
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,000  
At first, citizens were confused:  
“How do we live without our scooters?”

11  
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,000  
But a few years later, they’re sipping bubble tea,  
charging their e-bikes,

12  
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,000  
and reminiscing about their gas-powered days  
like it’s ancient history.

13  
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,000  
You can’t kill off gas bikes overnight.  
It takes finesse:

14  
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,000  
A little fear, a little funding,  
some penalties, and a lot of public charm.

15  
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,000  
Every policy stick works better when it’s sugar-coated —  

16  
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,000  
so the old bikes roll away,  
and the people smile while waving goodbye.
