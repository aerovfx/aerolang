Hawkers
Hawkers usually walk around selling fruit, food, clothes and all kinds of other stuff.
Some of them push carts from place to place, while others ride bikes or motorbikes to carry their goods around. Honestly, sometimes we hesitate to go to the market or grab a bite outside just because we’re too busy. But if they bring the goods right to our doorstep, hey, that saves time — and we’re more likely to buy. Plus, we still have the choice — to buy or not to buy.
That said, some street vendors do sell fake goods or spoiled food, and that’s pretty dangerous. Unsanitary food can cause food poisoning or serious illnesses like typhoid or dysentery...
Still, most hawkers are poor folks trying to make a living. They work hard every day. They don’t have stable jobs, but they’re trying to prove that they’re not useless — not just freeloaders.
Let’s be honest, we all want good jobs, right? But that’s not easy to come by especially when we prefer playing over studying! So remember this:
In the end, everything comes with a price!
