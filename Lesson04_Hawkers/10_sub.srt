00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hawkers usually walk around selling fruits, food, clothes, and all kinds of other stuff.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,000
Some of them push carts from place to other place, while others ride bikes or motorbikes to carry their goods around.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:17,000
Honestly, sometimes we hesitate to go to market or a shop outside just because we’re too busy.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,000
But if hawkers bring their goods right to our doorstep, we’re more likely to buy — it saves time.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,000
Plus, we still have the choice: to buy or not to buy.

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,000
That said, some hawkers do sell fake goods or spoiled food, and that’s really dangerous.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,000
Unsanitary food can cause food poisoning or serious illnesses like typhoid or dysentery.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,000
However, most hawkers are poor folks trying to make a living.

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,500
They have to work hard every day.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
They don’t have stable jobs, but they’re trying to prove that they’re not useless — not just freeloaders.

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,000
Let’s be honest, we all want good jobs.

12
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,000
But those are not easy to come by, especially when we prefer playing to studying!

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,000
So remember this:

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,000
In the end, everything has its value!
