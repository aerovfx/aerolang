Conversation: Talking About Hawkers (With Questions)

A: Hey, have you ever bought anything from a hawker? (Yes/No question)

B: Yeah, of course! Hawkers are everywhere.
A: What do they usually sell? (WH-question)
B: They usually walk around selling fruits, food, clothes, and all kinds of other stuff.

A: I’ve seen some pushing carts. Do others use bikes or motorbikes? (Yes/No question)
B: Yes, some do. They ride bikes or motorbikes to carry their goods around.

A: Why do you think people buy from hawkers instead of going to shops? (WH-question)
B: Honestly, sometimes we hesitate to go to the market or a shop because we’re just too busy. So when hawkers bring stuff right to our doorsteps, it saves time.

A: Yeah, it’s more convenient, isn’t it? (Tag question)
B: Definitely! Plus, we still have the choice — to buy or not to buy.

A: But do you think all hawkers sell safe products? (Yes/No question)
B: Not really. Some hawkers do sell fake goods or spoiled food, and that’s really dangerous.

A: What can happen if people eat spoiled food? (WH-question)
B: It can cause food poisoning or even serious illnesses like typhoid or dysentery.

A: That’s terrible. But most hawkers are just trying to earn a living, aren’t they? (Tag question)
B: Yeah, they are. They work hard every day. They don’t have stable jobs, but they’re trying to prove they’re not useless — not freeloaders.

A: What kind of jobs do you think they would prefer if they had the chance? (WH-question)
B: Probably something stable, like working in a shop or office. But jobs are hard to find these days.

A: We all want good jobs, don’t we? (Tag question)
B: Of course. But it’s not easy to get one — especially when we prefer playing to studying!

A: (laughs) So true. Everything has its value in the end, right? (Tag question)
B: Right! Even hawkers teach us something about effort and resilience.
