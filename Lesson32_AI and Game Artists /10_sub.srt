00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000  
Back in the day, creating game assets was a labor of love — and caffeine.

2  
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,000  
From concept art to modeling, texturing, rigging, animation —  
all handcrafted by people working late into the night.

3  
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,000  
Today, a few magic words like:  
“realistic female warrior, stylized armor, 4K textures, clean topology, rigged for UE5”

4  
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,000  
— click, wait a few minutes, and bam —  
a “brand new” asset pops out.

5  
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,000  
Complete with a style suspiciously familiar  
to hundreds of real-life artists the AI has “learned from.”

6  
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,000  
Which begs the question: who taught it?

7  
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,000  
Many AI models are trained on artwork scraped from real artists —  
without consent, credit, or compensation.

8  
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:33,000  
One day you’re browsing ArtStation,  
and suddenly you see your own signature style…

9  
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,000  
Repackaged as “original AI art.”

10  
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,000  
The worst part? You can’t sue an algorithm.

11  
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,000  
And the AI? It shrugs:  
“I’m just remixing data, bro.”

12  
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,000  
Amid the race to automate pipelines,  
a lot of studios are turning a blind eye to ethics.

13  
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,000  
Where did this AI asset come from?

14  
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,500  
Was someone’s work stolen to make it?

15  
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,500  
Whose style is being mimicked?

16  
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,000  
Is this “efficiency” worth the invisible cost?

17  
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,000  
Artists today are forced to both learn AI tools  
and protect their own identity from being absorbed into them.

18  
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,000  
It’s a twisted reality —  
the real creators are being replaced,

19  
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,000  
while plagiarized mashups are celebrated as “innovation.”

20  
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,000  
AI can streamline the pipeline —  
but it shouldn’t erase ethics.

21  
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,000  
Art is not just output;  
it’s ownership, effort, and soul.

22  
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,000  
If we forget that,  
then no matter how beautiful the game looks,

23  
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,000  
it’s built on hollow pixels and borrowed credit.
