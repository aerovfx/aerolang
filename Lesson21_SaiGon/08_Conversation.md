Tour Guide – Student Dialogue: A Visit to Saigon

Tour Guide:
Good morning, everyone! Welcome to our Saigon city tour. Are you ready for an exciting day?

Students:
Yes!

Tour Guide:
Great! Our first stop is Ben Thanh Market. Does anyone know how old it is?

Student 1:
Over 100 years old?

Tour Guide:
Correct! Very good. But remember — don’t buy too many things or you’ll get tired carrying them.

Student 2:
Can we try street food there?

Tour Guide:
Absolutely! But make sure you ask the price first. And don’t forget to stay together.

Student 3:
Where do we go after the market?

Tour Guide:
Next, we’ll visit Bui Vien Walking Street. It’s a popular place, but no bikes or motorbikes are allowed. If you enter with one, you could be fined up to 300,000 VND!

Student 4:
Wow! That’s a lot. What else will we see?

Tour Guide:
After that, we’ll go to Bach Dang Harbor, then Nha Rong Wharf, and finally, the zoo. You’ll see animals from all around the world.

Student 5:
Will we have time to rest?

Tour Guide:
Of course. We’ll relax at Turtle Lake and have a drink before continuing to the War Remnants Museum.

Student 6:
What’s in the museum?

Tour Guide:
You’ll learn about the history of war in Vietnam. It’s emotional, but very important. Many visitors say, “No more war in the world” after seeing it.

Student 7:
What if we get tired?

Tour Guide:
Then we find a nice restaurant to recover. Walking in Saigon is fun — but also a workout!

Students:
Let’s go!
