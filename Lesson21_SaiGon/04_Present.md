üé§ A Journey Through Saigon: More Than Just a City

Good morning, everyone.

Today, I want to take you on a journey ‚Äî not just to a place, but into the heart of one of Vietnam‚Äôs most dynamic and unforgettable cities: Saigon.

Saigon, or Ho Chi Minh City as it‚Äôs officially known, is not just big ‚Äî it‚Äôs alive. Home to over 10 million people, it pulses with energy, ambition, and stories at every corner. With two rivers ‚Äî the Saigon River and the Nha Be River ‚Äî flowing through it, this city has long been a crossroads of cultures, ideas, and dreams.

From my small hometown of Ba To, it takes about three hours by coach to reach Saigon ‚Äî assuming the traffic is kind, which, as you might imagine, it often isn‚Äôt. But the moment you arrive, everything changes.

Let‚Äôs begin at Suoi Tien Theme Park, a place where Vietnamese legends and modern amusement blend into something magical. From there, hop on a bus, and soon you‚Äôll find yourself at the iconic Ben Thanh Market, a 100-year-old cultural treasure. It‚Äôs a place where the smells of street food dance with the sound of bargaining voices ‚Äî and yes, where your legs might give out before your curiosity does.

A piece of advice: when exploring District 1, skip the high heels. Wear your most comfortable shoes, because Saigon invites you to walk ‚Äî and walk you will.

After Ben Thanh, we make our way to Bui Vien Walking Street, where the city never sleeps. But beware ‚Äî if you try to enter on a bicycle or motorbike, the fine could be up to 300,000 VND. Rules aside, this street is a celebration of youth, music, and freedom.

Then, we move to the quieter waters of Bach Dang Harbor and Nha Rong Wharf, where history whispers in the wind. You begin to feel that Saigon isn‚Äôt just modern ‚Äî it remembers.

We visit the Zoo, where animals from around the world remind us of the beauty of biodiversity. We stop at Turtle Lake, not for sightseeing, but to sit, sip a drink, and let the city slow down for just a moment.

But the most powerful stop on our journey is the War Remnants Museum. It‚Äôs not easy to walk through. It‚Äôs painful, eye-opening, and deeply human. And when you walk out, there‚Äôs only one thing left to say: ‚ÄúNo more war in the world.‚Äù

By the end of the day, your feet will hurt, your head will be spinning, and your heart will be full. And in that moment, you‚Äôll probably look at me and say, ‚ÄúCan we eat now?‚Äù

And I‚Äôll smile and say, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve still got the energy ‚Äî and a bit of cash ‚Äî how about we continue our adventure to Can Tho, the capital of Vietnam‚Äôs Western Region?‚Äù

Because that‚Äôs the thing about Saigon ‚Äî once you start exploring, it‚Äôs hard to stop.

Thank you.
