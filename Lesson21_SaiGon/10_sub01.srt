1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Saigon is a big city in Vietnam.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,000
It is located in southern Vietnam and has a population of about 10 million people.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,000
There are two major rivers in Saigon: the Saigon River and the Nha Be River.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,000
If there is no traffic jam, it takes about 3 hours to get to Saigon from Ba To by coach.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,000
After arriving at Suoi Tien Park, you can take a bus to Ben Thanh Market.

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,000
The ticket costs 10,000 VND. Children under 6 years old can travel for free.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,000
Before visiting District 1, you should wear sport shoes instead of high heels,

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,000
and carry light luggage because you will need to walk a lot.

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,500
Saigon has many places to visit.

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,000
First, we go to Ben Thanh Market, which is over 100 years old.

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,000
You shouldn’t buy too many things because you might not have enough strength to keep walking afterward.

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,500
Leaving Ben Thanh Market, we will visit the walking street — Bui Vien Street.

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,000
If you enter by bicycle or motorbike, you may be fined from 200,000 VND to 300,000 VND.

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,000
After the walking street, we will visit Bach Dang Harbor and Nha Rong Wharf.

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,500
Then, we visit the zoo, which has many animals from around the world.

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,000
After the zoo, we stop by Turtle Lake to relax and have a drink.

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,500
To continue, we visit the War Remnants Museum,

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,000
where you can learn about the brutality of war.

19
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,000
After leaving, everyone prays: “No more war in the world.”

20
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,000
I dare say, at this point, you probably just want to find a restaurant

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,000
to recover after a tiring day of walking.

22
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,000
If you have a lot of money, I’ll take you to visit Can Tho —

23
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,000
the capital of the Western Region. Please!
