00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:08,000
Today, I want to take you on a journey — not just to a place,
but into the heart of one of Vietnam’s most dynamic and unforgettable cities: Saigon.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:13,000
Saigon, or Ho Chi Minh City as it’s officially known, is not just big — it’s alive.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:18,000
Home to over 10 million people, it pulses with energy, ambition, and stories at every corner.

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,000
With two rivers — the Saigon River and the Nha Be River — flowing through it,
this city has long been a crossroads of cultures, ideas, and dreams.

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,000
From my small hometown of Ba To, it takes about three hours by coach to reach Saigon —
assuming the traffic is kind, which, as you might imagine, it often isn’t.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,000
But the moment you arrive, everything changes.

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,000
Let’s begin at Suoi Tien Theme Park,
a place where Vietnamese legends and modern amusement blend into something magical.

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,000
From there, hop on a bus, and soon you’ll find yourself at the iconic Ben Thanh Market,
a 100-year-old cultural treasure.

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,000
It’s a place where the smells of street food dance with the sound of bargaining voices —
and yes, where your legs might give out before your curiosity does.

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,000
A piece of advice: when exploring District 1, skip the high heels.

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,000
Wear your most comfortable shoes, because Saigon invites you to walk — and walk you will.

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,000
After Ben Thanh, we make our way to Bui Vien Walking Street, where the city never sleeps.

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,000
But beware — if you try to enter on a bicycle or motorbike,
the fine could be up to 300,000 VND.

15
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,500
Rules aside, this street is a celebration of youth, music, and freedom.

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,000
Then, we move to the quieter waters of Bach Dang Harbor and Nha Rong Wharf,
where history whispers in the wind.

17
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,500
You begin to feel that Saigon isn’t just modern — it remembers.

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,000
We visit the Zoo, where animals from around the world
remind us of the beauty of biodiversity.

19
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,000
We stop at Turtle Lake, not for sightseeing,
but to sit, sip a drink, and let the city slow down for just a moment.

20
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,500
But the most powerful stop on our journey is the War Remnants Museum.

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,000
It’s not easy to walk through. It’s painful, eye-opening, and deeply human.

22
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,000
And when you walk out, there’s only one thing left to say:
“No more war in the world.”

23
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,000
By the end of the day, your feet will hurt, your head will be spinning, and your heart will be full.

24
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,000
And in that moment, you’ll probably look at me and say, “Can we eat now?”

25
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,000
And I’ll smile and say,
“If you’ve still got the energy — and a bit of cash —
how about we continue our adventure to Can Tho, the capital of Vietnam’s Western Region?”

26
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,000
Because that’s the thing about Saigon — once you start exploring, it’s hard to stop.

27
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,000
Thank you.
