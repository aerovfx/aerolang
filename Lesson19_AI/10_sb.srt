AI at the Apex: NVIDIA, Lord of the Chips and Unofficial President of the Future

2
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:08,000
In 2025, AI isn't just a tech dream anymore — it's a global fever.

3
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:12,000
And the one selling the fever meds? None other than NVIDIA.

4
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:16,000
Once just a gaming graphics card company, NVIDIA is now the backbone of AI.

5
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:20,000
In July, it passed a $4 trillion market cap, beating Apple and Microsoft.

6
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:24,000
Tech no longer revolves around phones — it revolves around GPUs.

7
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:27,000
And Jensen Huang? Basically the unelected head of state.

8
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:31,000
Let’s talk upside. In 2025, NVIDIA made $130 billion in revenue.

9
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:35,000
Blackwell chips alone pulled in $11 billion in Q4.

10
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:39,000
Microsoft, Meta, Amazon — they all rely on NVIDIA to run their AI empires.

11
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:42,000
If AI is electricity, NVIDIA is the nuclear plant.

12
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:46,000
But here comes the downside: those chips are power-hungry monsters.

13
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:50,000
Data centers are inventing ways to cool them before they catch fire.

14
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:54,000
Nations talk about "sovereign AI" — but they still need NVIDIA to build it.

15
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:58,000
Meanwhile, humans worry: Can we compete with machines doing our jobs better?

16
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:02,000
And a single U.S. export ban could knock Southeast Asia off the AI map.

17
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:06,000
So what’s the big picture? NVIDIA isn’t just selling hardware anymore.

18
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:10,000
It’s selling the future — and redefining power in the AI age.

19
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:14,000
And while the world applauds, we should ask: Is AI freeing us or leashing us?
