🗣️ Conversation: “Do You Really Need to Exercise?”

Anna: Hey Ben, do you work out regularly?

Ben: Not really. I do a lot of physical work every day. I’m a bricklayer, so by the end of the day, I’m exhausted. Honestly, I just want to go home and relax.

Anna: That makes sense. I’ve read that people who do manual labor—like farmers or janitors—don’t really need extra exercise. Their jobs already keep them active.

Ben: Exactly! I feel like my body gets enough of a workout already.

Anna: On the other hand, people like me—sitting at a desk all day as a secretary—really need to move more. We don’t get much physical activity during work hours.

Ben: True. I guess you need to exercise to stay healthy.

Anna: Right. If we don’t use our muscles, they weaken. We gain weight, and it increases the risk of diseases.

Ben: So, what kind of exercise do you usually do?

Anna: I sometimes go jogging or take a dance class. Dancing, yoga, and aerobics are popular with a lot of girls I know.

Ben: That’s cool. I’ve heard running is the cheapest and easiest way to stay fit.

Anna: Totally! You don’t need equipment—just a pair of shoes. You can run early in the morning or in the evening.

Ben: And there’s that saying: “A sound mind in a sound body,” right?

Anna: Exactly! Exercise isn’t just good for the body, it’s good for the mind too.

Ben: You’ve got a point. Do you think exercising really helps you live longer?

Anna: Well, they say it does. Let me ask you: do you want the road from your house to the cemetery to be long or short?

Ben: (laughs) Definitely long! I guess I should start running too.
