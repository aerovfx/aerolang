00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000

Exercising is very important for our health.

00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,000
If we don’t use our muscles, they will weaken, our bodies will become obese, and many diseases will affect us.

We have many choices for exercising.

Do you want to prolong or shorten your life?

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,000

00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
That depends on your choice.
