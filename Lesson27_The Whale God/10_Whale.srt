The Whale God – Once a Sea Deity, Now a Floating Trash Can?

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:11,000
Back in the day, whales were sacred beings who saved fishermen at sea.

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,000
Now? They might need saving themselves.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:20,000
Fishermen once worshiped them as ocean guardians — today’s youth worship the views and chase viral content.

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,000
Vietnam’s waters are still blue — but mostly the blue of plastic bags.

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,000
Whales still surface — but it’s their stomachs that float, bloated from swallowing size-42 sandals.

7
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:33,000
We call their beaching “resting” out of respect.

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,000
Yet the way we dump trash into the sea is making them “rest” for real.

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:43,000
And now, every time a whale appears, it’s like a red carpet event for the content vultures:

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,000
drones buzzing overhead, cameras zoomed in straight into the poor whale’s mouth mid-meal.

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,000
The small fish it was about to eat? Gone — scared off by the sound of livestream notifications.

12
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,000
The whale opens its mouth for a bite, but instead ends up in the news with a caption like:

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,000
“Emotional moment as whale returns to Vietnamese waters.”

14
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,000
Meanwhile, reporters storm the beach to interview… the waves,

15
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,000
asking locals how they “felt witnessing such a spiritual event” —

16
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,000
while the whale just wants to eat in peace before it washes ashore from sheer anxiety.

17
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,000
Once a divine protector, now a victim of pollution — and TikTok.

18
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:23,000
In this modern-day mythology, the monster isn’t a dragon —

19
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,000
it’s the guy holding a smartphone on record.
