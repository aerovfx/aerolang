Today, traveling in Vietnam is quite difficult, especially in big cities like Hanoi, Da Nang, Sai Gon.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,000
The streets are often overcrowded and in a deteriorated state. Every day, traffic jams occur at intersections.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,500
Students, workers, and employees have to get up early to go to school or work, but traffic jams are unavoidable.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Sometimes, traffic police cannot manage the traffic effectively.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,000
To get around the city, we often spend much more time, especially during rush hours.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,000
In the rainy season, most of the roads are flooded because the drainage and sewage systems are frequently blocked.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,000
Another cause of traffic jams is that some people do not obey traffic laws.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,000
To move around the city, we can take a bus, a taxi, a cyclo.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,500
Taxis are expensive but fast and comfortable.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
While sitting in a taxi, we can sing, surf internet for updating information, watch movies.

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,000
If we want to travel from a city to another one, we can take a coach.

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,500
Vietnam has a pan Vietnamese railway system that connects Hanoi – our capital – with Sai Gon, which is known as the “Pearl of the Far East” in southern Vietnam.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,500
If we want to save time, we can travel by airplane.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Time is very precious, but unfortunately, many poor people cannot afford to fly anywhere. How sad it is.
