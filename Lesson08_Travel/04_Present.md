Travel

Today, traveling in Vietnam is quite difficult, especially in big cities like Hanoi, Da Nang, and Ho Chi Minh City.
The streets are often overcrowded, in a deteriorated state. Everyday, traffic jams always occur at intersections. Students, workkers, employees have get up early to go to school, to work but traffic jams always not evade. Sometime, traffic police do not control traffic.

To get around the city, we spend up much more time, especially in rush hours.
On the rainny season, All most of the road are flooded cause drainage system
and the drainage and sewage systems are frequently blocked. Another cause of traffic jams is that some people do not obey traffic laws.

To get around the city, we can take a bus, a taxi, or a cyclo. Taxis are expensive but fast and comfortable.
While sitting in a taxi, we can sing, search the internet for updated information, or even watch a movie.
If we want to travel from one city to another, we can take a long-distance bus or a train.
Vietnam has a railway system that connects Hanoi – the capital – with Ho Chi Minh City, which is known as the “Pearl of the Far East” in southern Vietnam.

If we want to save time, we can travel by airplane.
Time is very precious, but unfortunately, many poor people cannot afford to fly anywhere. That’s a sad reality.
