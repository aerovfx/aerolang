1  
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000  
Vietnamese people love football.

2  
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,000  
Not just weekend-kickaround love,  
but the kind of love that makes you skip school, skip work —  
sometimes skip paychecks — just to catch a match.

3  
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,000  
Every time the national team plays, it feels like a nationwide holiday.

4  
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,000  
Red flags, speakers blaring, pots and pans banging down every alley.

5  
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,000  
But behind the patriotic glow of this football fever  
lies a shady sideline… drenched in betting slips.

6  
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,000  
While mouths shout “Vietnam champions!”,  
fingers are quietly texting “over or under?”

7  
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,000  
The ball’s only been rolling for 10 minutes,  
but for some, heart rates have spiked like the betting odds.

8  
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,000  
Some are so “passionate” they sell their bikes,  
pawn their land deeds, go deep into debt —  
all for a striker’s lucky foot.

9  
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,000  
That uncle at the café, talking like a FIFA analyst?  
He’s actually praying for a goal to recover his losses.

10  
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,000  
And the neighbor lady?  
She doesn’t even like football, but turns on the TV because  
“if my husband wins, we eat pho;  
if he loses, it’s instant noodles for a week.”

11  
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:47,000  
Sport is meant to build spirit, health, and national pride.

12  
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,000  
But for many, it’s become training ground for dodging debt,  
chasing odds, and arguing with bookies.

13  
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,000  
Loving football is beautiful.

14  
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:00,000  
But if it costs you your house, your friendships, and your sanity,  
that’s not passion — that’s organized delusion.
