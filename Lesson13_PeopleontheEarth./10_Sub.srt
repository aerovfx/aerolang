00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Nowadays, the world population is 7.5 billion,  
and people live all over the Earth.

2
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:09,000
They live on the icy lands of the poles  
and in the tropical rainforests along the equator.

3
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:13,000
They have climbed high mountains,  
walked on the sea bed,  
and even left the Earth to visit the Moon.

4
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:16,000
Humans are the most numerous and powerful species on Earth.

5
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:20,000
Animals can do some things better than we can.  
Dogs can smell and hear better than we can.

6
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:23,000
Cats can see in the dark.  
Birds can fly thousands of miles  
and return to the exact same place every year.

7
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:28,000
But we are different. No animal builds churches,  
plays football, tells jokes, gets married,  
has prisons, bands, or presidential elections,  
or walks on the Moon.

8
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:33,000
There is one thing that sets us apart from animals:  
we love to talk, talk, and talk.

9
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:37,000
We are master communicators.  
We can communicate in many ways—  
with our facial expressions, our hands, our bodies, and our voices.

10
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:42,000
Most importantly, we can record what we say  
and write down what we think.

11
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:46,000
We can communicate through space and time.  
We have a sense of the past and of the future—  
not just the present.

12
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:50,000
We are the only species capable of changing the entire world.

13
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:54,000
We are the only species that can choose:  
either to take care of the world or to destroy it.
