Fix by teacher

Nowadays, the world population is 7.5 billion, and they live all over the Earth. They live on the icy lands of the poles and in the tropical rainforests along the equator. They have climbed high mountains, walked on the sea bed, and even some of them have left the Earth visited the Moon.
Human is the most numerous and powerful species on Earth.
Animals can do some things better than we can. Dogs can smell and hear better than us. Cats can see in the dark. Birds can fly thousands of miles and return to the exact same place every year.
But we are different. No animal builds churches, plays football, tells jokes, gets married, has prisons, bands, presidential elections, or walks on the Moon.
There is one thing that sets us apart from animals. We love to talk, talk, and talk. We are master of communicators. We can communicate in many ways: with our facial expressions, our hands, our bodies, and our voices. Most importantly, we can record what we say and write down what we think. We can communicate through space and time. We have a sense of the past, of the future—not just the present.
We are the only species capable of changing the entire world. We are the only species that can choose: either to take care for the world or to destroy it.

Analysis
✅ CÂU 1:

❌ They have climbed high mountains, walked on the sea bed, and even some of them have left the Earth visited the Moon.

🔴 Lỗi 1: cấu trúc không song song
	•	“They have climbed…, walked…, and even some of them have left…”
	•	Chủ ngữ “They” đang bị đứt gãy ở vế cuối: tự nhiên lại đổi sang “some of them” ⇒ câu thiếu mạch lạc.

🔴 Lỗi 2: sai động từ nguyên mẫu
	•	❌ “visited” đứng sau “have left the Earth” → sai ngữ pháp. Phải dùng động từ nguyên mẫu: “to visit”

✅ Câu sửa đúng:

✔️ They have climbed high mountains, walked on the sea bed, and even left the Earth to visit the Moon.
→ Dùng đúng cấu trúc song song và động từ nguyên mẫu.
Nếu dùng cấu trúc hiện tại hoàn thành cho toàn bộ câu thì nó sẽ mang ý nghĩa liệt kê tất cả các hành động như leo lên núi cao, đi dưới biển, rời Trái Đất và đến Mặt Trăng. Câu sửa lại như sau:
✔️ They have climbed high mountains, have walked on the sea bed, and have even left the Earth and visited the Moon.
Nếu viết như vậy thì ý rời Trái đất không còn bổ nghĩa và liên quan gì đến việc đến Mặt trăng.

⸻

✅ CÂU 2:

❌ Human is the most numerous and powerful species on Earth.

🔴 Lỗi 1: sai danh từ số ít
	•	“Human” là danh từ đếm được số ít → không phù hợp khi nói chung về loài người.

🔴 Lỗi 2: sai động từ
	•	“Human is” ⇒ sai vì khi bạn nói về cả loài người, thì chủ ngữ phải là số nhiều ⇒ “Humans are”

✅ Câu sửa đúng:

✔️ Humans are the most numerous and powerful species on Earth.

⸻

✅ CÂU 3:

❌ Dogs can smell and hear better than us.

🔴 Lỗi: dùng sai đại từ trong so sánh
	•	Câu so sánh “better than us” sai, vì sau than nên là một mệnh đề (có chủ ngữ + động từ).
	•	Dạng đúng: “better than we can” (rút gọn: Dogs can smell and hear better than we can.)

✅ Câu sửa đúng:

✔️ Dogs can smell and hear better than we can.

⸻

✅ CÂU 4:

❌ We are master of communicators.

🔴 Lỗi 1: sai cấu trúc danh từ
	•	“master of communicators” không chuẩn – nghe lạ và không tự nhiên trong tiếng Anh.

🔴 Lỗi 2: không có mạo từ hoặc số nhiều
	•	Nếu bạn dùng “master”, thì cần dùng số ít cho đối tượng:
	•	“We are a master of communication.” (OK)
	•	Nếu muốn nói rằng chúng ta giỏi giao tiếp, cách tự nhiên nhất là:
	•	“We are master communicators.”

✅ Câu sửa đúng:

✔️ We are master communicators.

⸻

✅ CÂU 5:

❌ …either to take care for the world or to destroy it.

🔴 Lỗi: sai giới từ đi với “take care”
	•	Cụm “take care” phải đi với “of”, không dùng “for” trong nghĩa “chăm sóc”

✅ Câu sửa đúng:

✔️ …either to take care of the world or to destroy it.

⸻

🔚 TỔNG KẾT CÁC LỖI

Câu	Lỗi chính	Cách sửa
1	Sai cấu trúc song song + sai động từ nguyên mẫu	“even left the Earth to visit the Moon”
2	Dùng danh từ số ít + sai động từ	“Humans are…”
3	Sai đại từ so sánh	“better than we can”
4	Cấu trúc danh từ không tự nhiên	“master communicators”
5	Sai giới từ	“take care of”

FINAL FIX

Nowadays, the world population is 7.5 billion, and people live all over the Earth. They live on the icy lands of the poles and in the tropical rainforests along the equator. They have climbed high mountains, walked on the sea bed, and even left the Earth to visit the Moon.

Humans are the most numerous and powerful species on Earth.

Animals can do some things better than we can. Dogs can smell and hear better than we can. Cats can see in the dark. Birds can fly thousands of miles and return to the exact same place every year.

But we are different. No animal builds churches, plays football, tells jokes, gets married, has prisons, bands, or presidential elections, or walks on the Moon.

There is one thing that sets us apart from animals: we love to talk, talk, and talk. We are master communicators. We can communicate in many ways—with our facial expressions, our hands, our bodies, and our voices. Most importantly, we can record what we say and write down what we think. We can communicate through space and time. We have a sense of the past and of the future—not just the present.

We are the only species capable of changing the entire world. We are the only species that can choose: either to take care of the world or to destroy it.
