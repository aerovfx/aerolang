Nowadays, the world population is 7.5 billion, and they live all over the Earth. They live on the icy lands of the poles and in the tropical rainforests along the equator. They have climbed highest mountains, walked on the sea bed, and even some of them have left the Earth to visit the Moon.
Humans are the most numerous and powerful species on Earth.
Animals can do some things better than we can. Dogs can smell and hear better than us. Cats can see in the dark. Birds can fly thousands of miles and return to the exact same place every year.
But we are different. No animal builds churches, plays football, tells jokes, gets married, has prisons, bands, presidential elections, or walks on the Moon.
There is one thing that sets us apart from animals. We love to talk, talk, and talk. We are master communicators. We can communicate in many ways: through our facial expressions, our hands, our bodies, and our voices. Most importantly, we can record what we say and write down what we think. We can communicate across space and time. We have a sense of the past, of the futureâ€”not just the present.
We are the only species capable of changing the entire world. We are the only species that can choose: to care for the world or to destroy it.
