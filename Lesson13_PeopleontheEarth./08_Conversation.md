Conversation about Humans and Communication

A:
Hey! I just read an interesting article about how humans are different from animals. Did you know that humans are the most numerous and powerful species on Earth?

B:
Really? That sounds fascinating. What makes us so powerful?

A:
Well, for one thing, we’ve walked on the sea bed, climbed high mountains, and even traveled to the Moon! But the most important difference is how we communicate.

B:
Communicate? You mean through language?

A:
Yes, but not just that. We use facial expressions, hand gestures, body language, and voices. No other species communicates in so many ways. And we can even record what we say!

B:
That’s true! Animals can communicate too, though. Like birds singing or dolphins clicking. So, what makes human communication more special?

A:
Good question. I think it’s because we can share ideas across time and space. For example, we can read books written hundreds of years ago or send messages to people on the other side of the world.
