Gen Z & Shopping: When “Add to Cart” Matters More Than Need

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,000
Back in the day, people went shopping with a list: meat, veggies, fish sauce — done.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:15,000
Today, Gen Z shops with a vibe: “This looks aesthetic,” “Adding to cart because mood,”

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,500
“Makes no sense but feels so right.”

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,000
Welcome to the age of emotional shopping — where style reigns and budgets take a nap.

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,000
For Gen Z, shopping isn’t just about buying what they need. It’s self-expression.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,000
An aesthetic declaration. A reward after a three-hour Zoom call.

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:36,000
Neon pink crocs? “Bought them because they looked dumb in a cute way.”

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,000
A mini juicer? “Because a TikTok said detox is a lifestyle!”

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,000
Shopping now needs no touching, no trying — just a 720p livestream

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,000
and someone shouting, “Last one, claim fast, besties!”

12
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,000
Trust now lies in a seller’s voice, LED lights, and background EDM.

13
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,000
Gen Z are masters of “add to cart but never checkout.”

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,000
A cart with 27 items? Only 2 actually bought — “I needed the feeling of choice.”

15
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,000
Sometimes they don’t buy out of need, but out of fear — fear of missing out.

16
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,000
FOMO isn’t just social anxiety — it’s a marketing strategy.

17
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,000
And no, they’re not rich — they’re creative spenders.

18
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,000
Split payments in 3, hunt flash sales at 2AM, collect free shipping codes like treasure.

19
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,000
Shopping is now a digital sport — speed and strategy matter.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,000
Truth is, Gen Z isn’t wasteful — they’re just buying “experiences.”

21
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,000
But if they’re not careful, that experience may come in a notification saying:

22
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,500
“Your account balance is below 2 dollars.”
