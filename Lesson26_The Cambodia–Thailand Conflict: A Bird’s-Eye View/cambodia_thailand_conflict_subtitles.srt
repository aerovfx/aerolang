00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
From above, the border between Thailand and Cambodia looks like a hairline crack on an old pane of glass.

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:13,000
When sunlight hits it just right, it reflects fragments of colonial memory — hazy and uncertain — as if even history isn’t quite sure where it belongs.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:21,000
Down below? Bullets are chambered with national pride, while keyboards across Vietnam clatter with commentary from people who couldn’t locate Preah Vihear on a map if their VPN depended on it.

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,000
Some cheer for Cambodia out of reflexive sympathy, others for Thailand — maybe because their last vacation there went smoothly.

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,000
Patriotism is now measured by gut reactions.

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:37,000
Reason is buried beneath a pile of “hot takes,” trending posts, and geopolitical explainers that last 59 seconds — complete with epic music and emoji subtitles.

7
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,000
Sometimes, it feels like history is being filmed vertically.

8
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:47,000
While journalists argue over the semantics of “territorial infringement,” influencers are livestreaming war updates with animated graphs and dramatic hand gestures.

9
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:56,000
Meanwhile, somewhere in the back rooms of policy offices, the real concern isn’t so much the border skirmishes, but that TikTok has replaced textbooks in teaching geography — with memes and irony filters.

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,000
Cambodia builds a temple complex, Thailand responds with barbed wire, and villagers on both sides live in quiet fear.

11
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,000
But a few clicks away, online spectators react like it’s a PvP showdown between rival guilds in some MMORPG.

12
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:13,000
No one remembers that Preah Vihear isn’t an NFT to be auctioned off — it’s a stone relic from a past that never stopped being political.

13
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:20,000
The old maps of Indochina were drawn with the shaky hands of drunk Frenchmen, but somehow it’s the people of Southeast Asia who bleed to maintain the lines.

14
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,000
Somewhere, someone in a cold office drafts a stern policy memo about “postcolonial strategy and the threat of color revolutions.”

15
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,000
Someone else whispers, “You think the CIA’s cooking up a Southeast Asian stew — low heat, just enough to simmer?”

16
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,000
Because modern conflict doesn’t always need bombs.

17
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,000
Sometimes all it takes is a subtle money trail, a carefully planted phrase, or a well-timed like.

18
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,000
And if we’re not careful, even trust can be bought — quietly — through an e-wallet.

19
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,000
From way up high, it’s hard to tell who’s right or wrong.

20
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:54,000
People shrink smaller, voices grow louder, but understanding? It just drifts farther out — like a weak radio signal.

21
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,000
Look closely and you’ll see that old temple still standing, silently caught between nations.

22
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:05,000
Maybe waiting for reconciliation... Or maybe just yawning, bored, at yet another century of conflicts with subtitles.

23
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:12,000
And while people on both sides die, lose homes, and bury loved ones — the governments that started it all don’t even lose a single hair.

24
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:17,000
Because war has never been about people hating people. It’s about power hating compromise.

25
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,000
It’s about third and fourth parties playing chess with blood-stained pieces.

26
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:28,000
And when it ends, it’s always the common folks who clean up the mess — while the players sip wine and write memoirs.
