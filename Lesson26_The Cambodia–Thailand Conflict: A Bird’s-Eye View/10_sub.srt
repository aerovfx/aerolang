00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000  
Dolphins are not fish, but rather warm-blooded mammals.

2  
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,000  
They live in groups and communicate with each other using their own language.

3  
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,000  
In this respect, they are similar to other animals, such as birds and bees.

4  
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,000  
Dolphins are very different from land-dwelling mammals.

5  
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,000  
Their brains are about the same size as ours.

6  
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,000  
They live fairly long livesâ€”at least 20 to 30 years.

7  
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,000  
Strangely, dolphins seem to like humans.

8  
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:32,000  
There are thousands of stories about friendships between dolphins and people.

9  
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,000  
Some dolphins often seek out humans.

10  
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:41,000  
They leave their groups and enter our harbors, swimming back and forth near beaches.

11  
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,000  
They like playing with people.

12  
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,000  
Nowadays, some countries still hunt dolphins for food.

13  
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,000  
But many nations around the world are now protecting them.

14  
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,000  
In these countries, killing dolphins is against the law.

15  
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,000  
In Vietnam, people greatly respect dolphins.

16  
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,000  
They see dolphins as sacred animals.

17  
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,000  
Vietnamese fishermen never dare to harm dolphins or whales.

18  
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,000  
They believe dolphins and whales bring them good luck.
