Topic: When Physics Stops Being Just Formulas

Hello everyone.

If you’ve ever thought physics was just dry equations and lifeless numbers — the 2025 national exam might surprise you.

Because this year, Physics told a story.

A story about a piece of iron inside a magnetic field.
A story about a light bulb that glows not just because of Ohm’s Law — but because someone believed it would.

For the first time, the exam included scenario-based questions.
Not just testing how many formulas you memorized — but how deeply you understand the world.

Instead of isolated facts, you were given real-world experiments to follow.
No more guessing answers.
You had to observe, reason, and sometimes… fail, then figure it out again.

This wasn’t physics on paper anymore.
It was physics in action.

And you didn’t have to be Einstein.
You just had to be curious enough to ask, “What’s happening here?”
And patient enough to follow the current of your own thoughts.

That’s what the 2025 Physics exam truly tested:
Not just your memory.
But the way you think.
