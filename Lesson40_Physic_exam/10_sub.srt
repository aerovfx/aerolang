Topic: When Physics Stops Being Just Formulas

2
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:04,500
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:09,000
If you’ve ever thought physics was just dry equations and lifeless numbers — the 2025 national exam might surprise you.

4
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:11,500
Because this year, Physics told a story.

5
00:00:11,501 --> 00:00:14,000
A story about a piece of iron inside a magnetic field.

6
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:17,000
A story about a light bulb that glows not just because of Ohm’s Law — but because someone believed it would.

7
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:20,500
For the first time, the exam included scenario-based questions.

8
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:24,000
Not just testing how many formulas you memorized — but how deeply you understand the world.

9
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:27,000
Instead of isolated facts, you were given real-world experiments to follow.

10
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:28,500
No more guessing answers.

11
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:31,500
You had to observe, reason, and sometimes… fail, then figure it out again.

12
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:34,000
This wasn’t physics on paper anymore.

13
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:35,500
It was physics in action.

14
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:38,500
And you didn’t have to be Einstein.

15
00:00:38,501 --> 00:00:41,500
You just had to be curious enough to ask, “What’s happening here?”

16
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:44,000
And patient enough to follow the current of your own thoughts.

17
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:47,000
That’s what the 2025 Physics exam truly tested:

18
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:48,500
Not just your memory.

19
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:50,500
But the way you think.
