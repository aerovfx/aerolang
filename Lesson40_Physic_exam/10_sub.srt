1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
When Physics is no longer… just formulas.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Hello, everyone.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,500
If I told you… this year’s Physics exam would surprise you,
would you believe me?

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,500
Because in 2025, Physics has changed.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,500
It has learned… to tell stories.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,500
A story about an iron core lying still in a magnetic field.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,500
A story about a light bulb that shines… not because of Ohm’s law,
but because of belief.

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:36,000
For the first time… the exam doesn’t just ask how many formulas you can remember.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,500
It asks:
How much do you truly understand?

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:45,000
Can you follow a phenomenon,
analyze the clues,
and explain it… like a scientist?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But there’s more.
Physics doesn’t stand alone.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,500
It shakes hands with Chemistry,
nods to Biology,
and smiles at Math… and Technology.

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:00,000
You have to connect.
You have to see the bigger picture.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You have to solve a question… that you’d never answer
if you treated each subject in isolation.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,500
This is no longer Physics on paper.
This… is Physics in real life.

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,500
You don’t have to be Einstein.

17
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,500
You just need enough curiosity to ask:
“What’s really going on here?”

18
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,000
And enough patience to trace…
the current of your own thinking.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,500
Because this exam…
doesn’t just test your memory.

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,500
It tests how you think.
How you connect ideas.
How you ask questions.

21
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:38,000
Because in the 21st century…
what matters is not how many formulas you know.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,500
What matters… is whether you can look at a phenomenon,
hear a story… and decode it.
