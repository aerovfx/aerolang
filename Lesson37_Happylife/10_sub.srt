1  
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000  
Happiness is just the state of mind, and it usually links with health.

2  
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,000  
Almost everyone thinks that only rich people have happiness.

3  
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,500  
Because they have a lot of money, but poor people do not.

4  
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,000  
But that is not right, because many rich people are not happy in their life.

5  
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,000  
Maybe they have no peace in their heart or not enough health to enjoy life.

6  
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,000  
If a poor person becomes a little rich, he wishes he would be richer.

7  
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,000  
His wish is never limited.

8  
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,500  
A billionaire never thinks that his health is enough.

9  
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,000  
I think the idea of a happy life is that we should be satisfied with what we have.

10  
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,000  
If we have a sufficient income, let's be content with it.

11  
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,000  
Vice versa, if we want to be richer and richer, we will come to the end of zero.

12  
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,000  
They say that: Your happiness will naturally disappear

13  
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,000  
if you keep looking for another greater happiness.

14  
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,000  
I hope: There is no need for both of you to try to find it.

15  
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,000  
It is always around you.
